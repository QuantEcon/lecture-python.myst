    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture describes how {cite:t}`Morris1996` extended the Harrisonâ€“Kreps model {cite}`HarrKreps1978` of speculative asset pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Harrison and Kreps's model, Morris's model determines the price of a dividend-yielding asset that is traded by risk-neutral investors who have heterogeneous beliefs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Harrison-Kreps model assumes that the traders have dogmatic, hard-wired beliefs about the asset's dividend stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "Morris replaced Harrison and Kreps's traders with  hard-wired beliefs about the dividend stream with traders who use Bayes' Law to update their beliefs about prospective dividends as new dividend data arrive.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Morris's traders don't use data on past prices of the asset to update their beliefs about the \n",
    "dividend process.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of the environment in Morris's model include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* All traders share a set  of statistical models for prospective dividends\n",
    "* A single parameter indexes the set of statistical models \n",
    "* All traders observe the same dividend history\n",
    "* All traders use Bayes' Law to update beliefs\n",
    "* Traders have different initial *prior distributions* over the parameter\n",
    "* Traders'  *posterior distributions* over the parameter eventually merge\n",
    "* Before their posterior distributions merge,  traders disagree about the  predictive density over prospective dividends \n",
    "    * therefore they disagree  about the value of the asset\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as in the hard-wired beliefs model of Harrison and Kreps, those differences of opinion induce  investors to  engage in *speculative behavior* in the following sense:\n",
    "\n",
    " * sometimes they are willing to pay more for the asset than what they think is its \"fundamental\" value, i.e., the expected discounted value of its prospective dividend stream \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to reading this lecture, you might want to review the following quantecon lectures:\n",

    "## Structure of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a fixed supply of shares of an asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each share entitles its owner to a stream of *binary* i.i.d. dividends $\\{d_t\\}$ where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "d_{t+1} \\in \\{0,1\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The dividend at time $t$ equals $1$ with unknown probability $\\theta \\in (0,1)$ and equals $0$ with probability $1-\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike {cite}`HarrKreps1978` where traders have hard-wired beliefs about a Markov transition matrix, in Morris's model:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The true dividend probability $\\theta$ is unknown\n",
    "* Traders have *prior beliefs* about $\\theta$\n",
    "* Traders observe dividend realizations and update beliefs via Bayes' Law\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a finite set $\\mathcal{I}$ of *risk-neutral* traders.\n",
    "\n",
    "All traders have the same discount factor $\\beta \\in (0,1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can think of $\\beta$ as being related to a net risk-free interest rate $r$ by $\\beta = 1/(1+r)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Owning the asset at the end of period $t$ entitles the owner to dividends at time $t+1, t+2, \\ldots$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the dividend process is i.i.d.,  trader $i$ thinks that  the fundamental value of the asset is the capitalized value of the dividend stream, namely,  $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\beta^j \\hat \\theta_i \n",
    "= \\frac{\\hat \\theta_i}{r}$, where $\\hat \\theta_i$ is the mean of the  trader's posterior distribution over $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible trades\n",
    "\n",
    "Traders buy and sell the risky asset in competitive markets each period $t = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots$ after dividends are paid.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in Harrison-Kreps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The asset is traded *ex dividend*\n",
    "* An owner of a share at the end of time $t$ is entitled to the dividend at time $t+1$\n",
    "* An owner of a share at the end of period $t$ also has the right to sell the share at time $t+1$ after having received the dividend at time $t+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Short sales are prohibited*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This matters because it limits how pessimists can express their opinions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* They *can* express themselves by selling their shares\n",
    "* They *cannot* express themselves more emphatically by borrowing shares and immediately selling them\n",
    "\n",
    "All traders have sufficient wealth to purchase the risky asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Information and beliefs\n",
    "\n",
    "At time $t \\geq 1$, all traders observe  $(d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "All traders update their subjective distribution over $\\theta$ by applying Bayes' rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traders have *heterogeneous priors* over the unknown dividend probability $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This heterogeneity in priors produces heterogeneous posterior beliefs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Source of heterogeneous priors\n",
    "\n",
    "Imputing different statistical models to agents inside a model is controversial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many  game theorists and rational expectations applied economists think it is a bad idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these economists often construct models in which agents have different *information*, they prefer to assume that all of the agents inside their model always share the same statistical model -- i.e., the same joint probability distribution over the random process being modeled.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For a statistician or an economic theorist, a statistical model is a joint probability distribution that is characterized  by a known parameter vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with  a *set* of statistical models swept out  by  parameters, say $\\theta$ in a known set $\\Theta$, economic theorists \n",
    "reduce the set of models to a single model by imputing to all agents inside the model the same prior probability distribution over $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "A set of statistical models that has a particular geometric structure is called a [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold)  of statistical models. Morris endows traders with a shared  manifold of statistical models.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Proceeding in this way adheres to  the *Harsanyi Common Priors Doctrine*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "{cite}`harsanyi1967games`,  {cite}`harsanyi1968games`,  {cite}`harsanyi1968games3` argued that if two rational agents have\n",
    "the same information and the same reasoning capabilities, they will have the same joint probability distribution over outcomes of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Harsanyi interpreted disagreements about prospective outcomes  as arising from differences in agents'  information sets,  not  differences in their  statistical models. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Evidently,  {cite}`HarrKreps1978` departed from the  Harsanyi common statistical model assumption when they  hard-wired dogmatic disparate beliefs.\n",
    "\n",
    "{cite:t}`Morris1996`  abandons the Harsanyi doctrine less completely  than Harrison and Kreps had. \n",
    "\n",
    "  * Morris does assume that agents share the same set of statistical models, but $\\ldots$\n",
    "  * Morris assumes that they have different initial prior distributions over the parameter that indexes the  models  \n",
    "\n",
    "Morris's agents  express their initial ignorance about the parameter differently -- they have different priors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Morris defends his assumption by alluding to the apparent ''mispricing'' of initial public offerings presented by {cite}`miller1977risk`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Miller described  a situation in which agents have access to  little or no data about a new enterprise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Morris wanted his traders to be open to changing their opinions as information about the parameter  arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledgeable statisticians have been known to disagree about an appropriate prior.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Morris described   *different* respectable ways to express ''maximal ignorance'' about the parameter of a Bernoulli distribution\n",
    "\n",
    " * a uniform distribution on $[0, 1]$\n",
    " * a Jeffreys prior {cite}`jeffreys1946invariant` that is invariant to reparameterization; in the present situation, the Jeffreys prior takes the form of a Beta distribution with parameters  $.5, .5$\n",
    "\n",
    "Is one of these priors more ''rational'' than the other?\n",
    "\n",
    "Morris thinks not. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
