    "Although the topic sounds trivial, this kind of trade-off between current\n",
    "and future utility is at the heart of many savings and consumption problems.\n",

    "* $c_t$ is called the **control variable** or the **action**\n",
    "* $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ are **parameters**\n",

    "### Trade-Off\n",
    "\n",
    "The key trade-off in the cake-eating problem is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Delaying consumption is costly because of the discount factor.\n",
    "* But delaying some consumption is also attractive because $u$ is concave.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concavity of $u$ implies that the consumer gains value from\n",
    "*consumption smoothing*, which means spreading consumption out over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because concavity implies diminishing marginal utility---a progressively smaller gain in utility for each additional spoonful of cake consumed within one period.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasoning given above suggests that the discount factor $\\beta$ and the curvature parameter $\\gamma$ will play a key role in determining the rate of consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an educated guess as to what impact these parameters will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, higher $\\beta$ implies less discounting, and hence the agent is more patient, which should reduce the rate of consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, higher $\\gamma$ implies that marginal utility $u'(c) =\n",
    "c^{-\\gamma}$ falls faster with $c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests more smoothing, and hence a lower rate of consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, we expect the rate of consumption to be *decreasing in both\n",
    "parameters*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see if this is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Value Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of our dynamic programming treatment is to obtain the Bellman\n",
    "equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to use it to calculate the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Bellman Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, we let $v(x)$ be maximum lifetime utility attainable from\n",
    "the current time when $x$ units of cake are left.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is,\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: value_fun\n",
    "\n",
    "v(x) = \\max \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^t u(c_t)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where the maximization is over all paths $\\{ c_t \\}$ that are feasible\n",
    "from $x_0 = x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we do not have an expression for $v$, but we can still\n",
    "make inferences about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, as was the case with the {doc}`McCall model <mccall_model>`, the\n",
    "value function will satisfy a version of the *Bellman equation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the present case, this equation states that $v$ satisfies\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: bellman-cep\n",
    "\n",
    "v(x) = \\max_{0\\leq c \\leq x} \\{u(c) + \\beta v(x-c)\\}\n",
    "\\quad \\text{for any given } x \\geq 0.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition here is essentially the same it was for the McCall model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing $c$ optimally means trading off current vs future rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Current rewards from choice $c$ are just $u(c)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future rewards given current cake size $x$, measured from next period and\n",
    "assuming optimal behavior, are $v(x-c)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the two terms on the right hand side of {eq}`bellman-cep`, after\n",
    "suitable discounting.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $c$ is chosen optimally using this trade off strategy, then we obtain maximal lifetime rewards from our current state $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, $v(x)$ equals the right hand side of {eq}`bellman-cep`, as claimed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An Analytical Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been shown that, with $u$ as the CRRA utility function in\n",
    "{eq}`crra_utility`, the function\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
