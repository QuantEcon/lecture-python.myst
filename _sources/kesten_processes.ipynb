    "1. A number of significant economic processes are or can be described as Kesten processes.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the present context, we can define a stationary distribution as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution $F^*$ on $\\mathbb R$ is called **stationary** for the\n",
    "Kesten process {eq}`kesproc` if\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: kp_stationary0\n",
    "\n",
    "X_t \\sim F^*\n",
    "\\quad \\implies \\quad\n",
    "a_{t+1} X_t + \\eta_{t+1} \\sim F^*\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if the current state $X_t$ has distribution $F^*$,\n",
    "then so does the next period state $X_{t+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write this alternatively as\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: kp_stationary\n",
    "\n",
    "F^*(y) = \\int \\mathbb P\\{ a_{t+1} x + \\eta_{t+1} \\leq y\\} F^*(dx)\n",
    "\\quad \\text{for all } y \\geq 0.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The left hand side is the distribution of the next period state when the\n",
    "current state is drawn from $F^*$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equality in {eq}`kp_stationary` states that this distribution is unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-Sectional Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an important cross-sectional interpretation of stationary distributions, discussed previously but worth repeating here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose, for example, that we are interested in the wealth distribution --- that is, the current distribution of wealth across households in a given country.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose further that\n",
    "\n",
    "* the wealth of each household evolves independently according to\n",
    "  {eq}`wealth_dynam`,\n",
    "* $F^*$ is a stationary distribution for this stochastic process and\n",
    "* there are many households.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then $F^*$ is a steady state for the cross-sectional wealth distribution in this country.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if $F^*$ is the current wealth distribution then it will\n",
    "remain so in subsequent periods, *ceteris paribus*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see this, suppose that $F^*$ is the current wealth distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the fraction of households with wealth less than $y$ next\n",
    "period?\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain this, we sum the probability that wealth is less than $y$ tomorrow, given that current wealth is $w$, weighted by the fraction of households with wealth $w$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Noting that the fraction of households with wealth in interval $dw$ is $F^*(dw)$, we get\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int \\mathbb P\\{ R_{t+1} s w  + y_{t+1} \\leq y\\} F^*(dw)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By the definition of stationarity and the assumption that $F^*$ is stationary for the wealth process, this is just $F^*(y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence the fraction of households with wealth in $[0, y]$ is the same\n",
    "next period as it is this period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $y$ was chosen arbitrarily, the distribution is unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditions for Stationarity\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kesten process $X_{t+1} = a_{t+1} X_t + \\eta_{t+1}$ does not always\n",
    "have a stationary distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if $a_t \\equiv \\eta_t \\equiv 1$ for all $t$, then\n",
    "$X_t = X_0 + t$, which diverges to infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent this kind of divergence, we require that $\\{a_t\\}$ is\n",
    "strictly less than 1 most of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, if\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: kp_stat_cond\n",
    "\n",
    "\\mathbb E \\ln a_t < 0\n",
    "\\quad \\text{and} \\quad\n",
    "\\mathbb E \\eta_t < \\infty\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then a unique stationary distribution exists on $\\mathbb R_+$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* See, for example, theorem 2.1.3 of {cite}`buraczewski2016stochastic`, which provides slightly weaker conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As one application of this result, we see that the wealth process\n",
    "{eq}`wealth_dynam` will have a unique stationary distribution whenever\n",
    "labor income has finite mean and $\\mathbb E \\ln R_t  + \\ln s < 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Heavy Tails\n",
    "\n",
    "Under certain conditions, the stationary distribution of a Kesten process has\n",
    "a Pareto tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "(See our {doc}`earlier lecture <intro:heavy_tails>`  on heavy-tailed distributions for background.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This fact is significant for economics because of the prevalence of Pareto-tailed distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Kesten--Goldie Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "To state the conditions under which the stationary distribution of a Kesten process has a Pareto tail, we first recall that a random variable is called **nonarithmetic** if its distribution is not concentrated on $\\{\\dots, -2t, -t, 0, t, 2t, \\ldots \\}$ for any $t \\geq 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, any random variable with a density is nonarithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The famous Kesten--Goldie Theorem (see, e.g., {cite}`buraczewski2016stochastic`, theorem 2.4.4) states that if\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the stationarity conditions in {eq}`kp_stat_cond` hold,\n",
    "1. the random variable $a_t$ is positive with probability one and nonarithmetic,\n",
    "1. $\\mathbb P\\{a_t x + \\eta_t = x\\} < 1$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb R_+$ and\n",
    "1. there exists a positive constant $\\alpha$ such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb E a_t^\\alpha = 1,\n",
    "    \\quad\n",
    "\\mathbb E \\eta_t^\\alpha < \\infty,\n",
    "    \\quad \\text{and} \\quad\n",
    "\\mathbb E [a_t^{\\alpha+1} ] < \\infty\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "then the stationary distribution of the Kesten process has a Pareto tail with\n",
    "tail index $\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, if $F^*$ is the unique stationary distribution and $X^* \\sim F^*$, then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} x^\\alpha \\mathbb P\\{X^* > x\\} = c\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for some positive constant $c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Later we will illustrate the Kesten--Goldie Theorem using rank-size plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to doing so, we can give the following intuition for the conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two important conditions are that $\\mathbb E \\ln a_t < 0$, so the model\n",
    "is stationary, and $\\mathbb E a_t^\\alpha = 1$ for some $\\alpha >\n",
    "0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first condition implies that the distribution of $a_t$ has a large amount of probability mass below 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second condition implies that the distribution of $a_t$ has at least some probability mass at or above 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first condition gives us existence of the stationary condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second condition means that the current state can be expanded by $a_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this occurs for several concurrent periods, the effects compound each other, since $a_t$ is multiplicative.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to spikes in the time series, which fill out the extreme right hand tail of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spikes in the time series are visible in the following simulation, which generates of 10 paths when $a_t$ and $b_t$ are lognormal."

    "As noted in our {doc}`lecture on heavy tails <intro:heavy_tails>`, for common measures of firm size such as revenue or employment, the US firm size distribution exhibits a Pareto tail (see, e.g., {cite}`axtell2001zipf`, {cite}`gabaix2016power`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us try to explain this rather striking fact using the Kesten--Goldie Theorem.\n",

    "for some positive IID sequence $\\{a_t\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One implication of Gibrat's law is that the growth rate of individual firms\n",
    "does not depend on their size.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, over the last few decades, research contradicting Gibrat's law has\n",
    "accumulated in the literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, it is commonly found that, on average,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. small firms grow faster than large firms (see, e.g., {cite}`evans1987relationship` and {cite}`hall1987relationship`) and\n",
    "1. the growth rate of small firms is more volatile than that of large firms {cite}`dunne1989growth`.\n",

    "On the other hand, Gibrat's law is generally found to be a reasonable\n",
    "approximation for large firms {cite}`evans1987relationship`.\n",
