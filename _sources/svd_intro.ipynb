    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The **singular value decomposition** (SVD) is a work-horse in applications of least squares projection that\n",
    "form  foundations for many statistical and  machine learning methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "After defining the SVD, we'll describe how it connects to \n",
    "\n",
    "* **four fundamental spaces** of linear algebra\n",
    "* under-determined and over-determined **least squares regressions**  \n",
    "* **principal components analysis** (PCA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Like principal components analysis (PCA), DMD can be thought of as a data-reduction procedure that  represents salient patterns by projecting data onto a limited set of factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sequel to this lecture about  {doc}`Dynamic Mode Decompositions <var_dmd>`, we'll describe how SVD's provide ways rapidly to compute reduced-order approximations to first-order Vector Autoregressions (VARs).\n",
    "\n",
    "##  The Setting\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X$ be an $m \\times n$ matrix of rank $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Necessarily, $p \\leq \\min(m,n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In  much of this lecture, we'll think of $X$ as a matrix of **data** in which\n",
    "\n",
    "  * each column is an **individual** -- a time period or person, depending on the application\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * each row is a **random variable** describing an attribute of a time period or a person, depending on the application\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "We'll be interested in  two  situations\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A **short and fat** case in which $m << n$, so that there are many more columns (individuals) than rows (attributes).\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A  **tall and skinny** case in which $m >> n$, so that there are many more rows  (attributes) than columns (individuals). \n",
    "    \n",
    "   \n",
    "We'll apply a **singular value decomposition** of $X$ in both situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the $ m < < n$ case  in which there are many more individuals $n$ than attributes $m$, we can calculate sample moments of  a joint distribution  by taking averages  across observations of functions of the observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this $ m < < n$ case,  we'll look for **patterns** by using a **singular value decomposition** to do a **principal components analysis** (PCA).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the $m > > n$  case in which there are many more attributes $m$ than individuals $n$ and when we are in a time-series setting in which $n$ equals the number of time periods covered in the data set $X$, we'll proceed in a different way. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll again use a **singular value decomposition**,  but now to construct a **dynamic mode decomposition** (DMD)\n",

    "\n",
    "* The $p$ singular values are positive square roots of the eigenvalues of the $m \\times m$ matrix  $X X^\\top $ and also of the $n \\times n$ matrix $X^\\top  X$\n",

    "* Similarly, when $V$ is a complex valued matrix, $V^\\top $ denotes the **conjugate-transpose** or **Hermitian-transpose** of $V$\n",

    "* multiplying vectors by the diagonal  matrix $\\Sigma$ leaves **angles between vectors** unchanged but **rescales** vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, representation {eq}`eq:SVD101` asserts that multiplying an $n \\times 1$  vector $y$ by the $m \\times n$ matrix $X$\n",
