    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The **singular value decomposition** is a work-horse in applications of least squares projection that\n",
    "form a foundation for  some important machine learning methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture describes the singular value decomposition and two of its uses:\n",
    "\n",
    " * principal components analysis (PCA)\n",
    "\n",
    " * dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)\n",
    "\n",
    " Each of these can be thought of as a data-reduction procedure  designed to capture salient patterns by projecting data onto a limited set of factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  The Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X$ be an $m \\times n$ matrix of rank $r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Necessarily, $r \\leq \\min(m,n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we'll think of $X$ as a matrix of **data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * each column is an **individual** -- a time period or person, depending on the application\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * each row is a **random variable** measuring an attribute of a time period or a person, depending on the application\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "We'll be interested in  two  cases\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A **short and fat** case in which $m << n$, so that there are many more columns than rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A  **tall and skinny** case in which $m >> n$, so that there are many more rows than columns. \n",
    "    \n",
    "   \n",
    "We'll apply a **singular value decomposition** of $X$ in both situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first case in which there are many more observations $n$ than random variables $m$, we learn about a joint distribution  by taking averages  across observations of functions of the observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll look for **patterns** by using a **singular value decomposition** to do a **principal components analysis** (PCA).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second case in which there are many more random variables $m$ than observations $n$, we'll proceed in a different way. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll again use a **singular value decomposition**,  but now to do a **dynamic mode decomposition** (DMD)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Singular Value Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "A **singular value decomposition** of an $m \\times n$ matrix $X$ of rank $r \\leq \\min(m,n)$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X  = U \\Sigma V^T\n",
    "$$\n",

    "* $V$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix whose columns are eigenvectors of $X X^T$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\Sigma$ is an $m \\times n$ matrix in which the first $r$ places on its main diagonal are positive numbers $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\ldots, \\sigma_r$ called **singular values**; remaining entries of $\\Sigma$ are all zero\n",
    "\n",
    "* The $r$ singular values are square roots of the eigenvalues of the $m \\times m$ matrix  $X X^T$ and the $n \\times n$ matrix $X^T X$\n",
    "\n",
    "* When $U$ is a complex valued matrix, $U^T$ denotes the **conjugate-transpose** or **Hermitian-transpose** of $U$, meaning that \n",
    "$U_{ij}^T$ is the complex conjugate of $U_{ji}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Similarly, when $V$ is a complex valued matrix, $V^T$ denotes the **conjugate-transpose** or **Hermitian-transpose** of $V$\n",
    "\n",
    "In what is called a **full** SVD, the  shapes of $U$, $\\Sigma$, and $V$ are $\\left(m, m\\right)$, $\\left(m, n\\right)$, $\\left(n, n\\right)$, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also an alternative shape convention called an **economy** or **reduced** SVD .\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, note that because we assume that $X$ has rank $r$, there are only $r $ nonzero singular values, where $r=\\textrm{rank}(X)\\leq\\min\\left(m, n\\right)$.  \n",
    "\n",
