    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The **singular value decomposition** (SVD) is a work-horse in applications of least squares projection that\n",
    "form  foundations for many statistical and  machine learning methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "After defining the SVD, we'll describe how it connects to\n",
    "\n",
    "* **four fundamental spaces** of linear algebra\n",
    "* under-determined and over-determined **least squares regressions**\n",
    "* **principal components analysis** (PCA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Like principal components analysis (PCA), DMD can be thought of as a data-reduction procedure that  represents salient patterns by projecting data onto a limited set of factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sequel to this lecture about  {doc}`Dynamic Mode Decompositions <var_dmd>`, we'll describe how SVD's provide ways rapidly to compute reduced-order approximations to first-order Vector Autoregressions (VARs).\n",

    "##  The Setting\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X$ be an $m \\times n$ matrix of rank $p$.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* each row is a **random variable** describing an attribute of a time period or a person, depending on the application\n",

    "\n",
    "* A  **tall and skinny** case in which $m >> n$, so that there are many more rows  (attributes) than columns (individuals).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll apply a **singular value decomposition** of $X$ in both situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the $ m < < n$ case  in which there are many more individuals $n$ than attributes $m$, we can calculate sample moments of  a joint distribution  by taking averages  across observations of functions of the observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this $ m < < n$ case,  we'll look for **patterns** by using a **singular value decomposition** to do a **principal components analysis** (PCA).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the $m > > n$  case in which there are many more attributes $m$ than individuals $n$ and when we are in a time-series setting in which $n$ equals the number of time periods covered in the data set $X$, we'll proceed in a different way.\n",
