    "\n",
    "The difference is that the value of accepting is $v_e(w)$ rather than\n",

    "\n",
    "We have to make this change because jobs are not permanent.\n",

    "This means precisely that the value of accepting is higher than the value of rejecting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function $v_e$ is increasing in $w$, since an employed agent is never made worse off by a higher current wage.\n",
