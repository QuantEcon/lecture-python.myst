    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first illustration of a rational expectations equilibrium involves a market with a unit measure of identical  firms, each of which seeks to maximize the discounted present value of profits in the face of adjustment costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adjustment costs induce the firms to make gradual adjustments, which in turn requires consideration of future prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual firms understand that, via the inverse demand curve, the price is determined by the amounts supplied by other firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence each firm wants to  forecast future total industry output.\n",

    "Rational expectations equilibrium prevails when this belief coincides with the actual\n",
    "law of motion generated by production choices induced by this belief.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In particular, it chooses a production plan to maximize\n",

    "Regarding timing, the firm observes $p_t$ and $y_t$ when it chooses $y_{t+1}$ at time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To state the firm's optimization problem completely requires that we specify dynamics for all state variables.\n",

    "This includes ones that the firm cares about but does not control like $p_t$.\n",

    "We turn to this problem now.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prices and Aggregate Output\n",
    "\n",
    "In view of {eq}`ree_comp3d`, the firm's incentive to forecast the market price translates into an incentive to forecast aggregate output $Y_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregate output depends on the choices of other firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output $y_t(\\omega)$ of a single firm $\\omega$ has a negligible effect on aggregate output $\\int_0^1 y_t(\\omega) d \\omega$.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The *belief function* $H$ is an equilibrium object, and hence remains to be determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optimal Behavior Given Beliefs\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let's fix a particular belief $H$ in {eq}`ree_hlom` and investigate the firm's response to it.\n",
    "\n",

    "* the terminal condition $\\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty } \\beta^t y_t v_y(y_{t}, Y_t) = 0$.\n",

    "### Definition of Rational Expectations Equilibrium\n",
    "\n",
    "A *rational expectations equilibrium* or *recursive competitive equilibrium*  of the model with adjustment costs is a decision rule $h$ and an aggregate law of motion $H$ such that\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given belief $H$, the map $h$ is the firm's optimal policy function.\n",
    "1. The law of motion $H$ satisfies $H(Y)= h(Y,Y)$ for all\n",

    "#### Fixed Point Characterization\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've seen, the firm's optimum problem induces a mapping $\\Phi$ from a perceived law of motion $H$ for market-wide output to an actual law of motion $\\Phi(H)$.\n",
