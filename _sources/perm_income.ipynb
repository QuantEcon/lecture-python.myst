    "For example, the current wealth of a gambler engaged in a \"fair game\" has this\n",

    "[^f2]: A linear marginal utility is essential for deriving {eq}`sprob5` from {eq}`sprob4`.  Suppose instead that we had imposed the following more standard assumptions on the utility function: $u'(c) >0, u''(c)<0, u'''(c) > 0$ and required that $c \\geq 0$.  The Euler equation remains {eq}`sprob4`. But the fact that $u''' <0$ implies via Jensen's inequality that $\\mathbb{E}_t [u'(c_{t+1})] >  u'(\\mathbb{E}_t [c_{t+1}])$.  This inequality together with {eq}`sprob4` implies that $\\mathbb{E}_t [c_{t+1}] > c_t$ (consumption is said to be a 'submartingale'), so that consumption stochastically diverges to $+\\infty$.  The consumer's savings also diverge to $+\\infty$.\n",
