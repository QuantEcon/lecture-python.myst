    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we again study the {doc}`McCall job search model with separation <mccall_model_with_separation>`, but now with a continuous wage distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we already considered continuous wage distributions briefly in the\n",
    "exercises of the {doc}`first job search lecture <mccall_model>`,\n",
    "the change was relatively trivial in that case.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because we were able to reduce the problem to solving for a single\n",
    "scalar value (the continuation value).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, with separation, the change is less trivial, since a continuous wage distribution leads to an uncountably infinite state space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The infinite state space leads to additional challenges, particularly when it\n",
    "comes to applying value function iteration (VFI).\n",
    "\n",
    "These challenges will lead us to modify VFI by adding an interpolation step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of VFI and this interpolation step is called **fitted value function iteration** (fitted VFI).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fitted VFI is very common in practice, so we will take some time to work through the details.\n",

    "## The Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is the same as the McCall model with job separation we {doc}`studied before <mccall_model_with_separation>`, except that the wage offer distribution is continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to start with the two Bellman equations we obtained for the model with job separation after {ref}`a simplifying transformation <ast_mcm>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modified to accommodate continuous wage draws, they take the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: bell1mcmc\n",
    "\n",
    "d = \\int \\max \\left\\{ v(w'), \\,  u(c) + \\beta d \\right\\} q(w') d w'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: bell2mcmc\n",
    "\n",
    "v(w) = u(w) + \\beta\n",
    "    \\left[\n",
    "        (1-\\alpha)v(w) + \\alpha d\n",
    "    \\right]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The unknowns here are the function $v$ and the scalar $d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between these and the pair of Bellman equations we previously worked on are\n",
    "\n",
    "1. in {eq}`bell1mcmc`, what used to be a sum over a finite number of wage values is an integral over an infinite set.\n",
    "1. The function $v$ in {eq}`bell2mcmc` is defined over all $w \\in \\mathbb R_+$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function $q$ in {eq}`bell1mcmc` is the density of the wage offer distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its support is taken as equal to $\\mathbb R_+$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Value Function Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, we should now proceed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Begin with a guess $v, d$ for the solutions to {eq}`bell1mcmc`--{eq}`bell2mcmc`.\n",
    "1. Plug $v, d$ into the right hand side of {eq}`bell1mcmc`--{eq}`bell2mcmc` and\n",
    "   compute the left hand side to obtain updates $v', d'$\n",
    "1. Unless some stopping condition is satisfied, set $(v, d) = (v', d')$\n",
    "   and go to step 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a problem we must confront before we implement this procedure:\n",
    "The iterates of the value function can neither be calculated exactly nor stored on a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the issue, consider {eq}`bell2mcmc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if $v$ is a known function,  the only way to store its update $v'$\n",
    "is to record its value $v'(w)$ for every $w \\in \\mathbb R_+$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, this is impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fitted Value Function Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "What we will do instead is use **fitted value function iteration**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let a current guess $v$ be given.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we record the value of the function $v'$ at only\n",
    "finitely many \"grid\" points $w_1 < w_2 < \\cdots < w_I$ and then reconstruct $v'$ from this information when required.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, the algorithm will be\n",
    "\n",
    "(fvi_alg)=\n",
    "1. Begin with an array $\\mathbf v$ representing the values of an initial guess of the value function on some grid points $\\{w_i\\}$.\n",
    "1. Build a function $v$ on the state space $\\mathbb R_+$ by interpolation or approximation, based on $\\mathbf v$ and $\\{ w_i\\}$.\n",
    "1. Obtain and record the samples of the updated function $v'(w_i)$ on each grid point $w_i$.\n",
    "1. Unless some stopping condition is satisfied, take this as the new array and go to step 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "How should we go about step 2?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a problem of function approximation, and there are many ways to approach it.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's important here is that the function approximation scheme must not only\n",
    "produce a good approximation to each $v$, but also that it combines well with the broader iteration algorithm described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "One good choice from both respects is continuous piecewise linear interpolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method\n",
    "\n",
    "1. combines well with value function iteration (see., e.g.,\n",
    "   {cite}`gordon1995stable` or {cite}`stachurski2008continuous`) and\n",
    "1. preserves useful shape properties such as monotonicity and concavity/convexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear interpolation will be implemented using [numpy.interp](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.interp.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The next figure illustrates piecewise linear interpolation of an arbitrary\n",
