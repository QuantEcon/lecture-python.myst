    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Social stigmas can inhibit people from confessing potentially embarrassing activities or opinions. \n",
    "\n",
    "When people are reluctant to participate a sample survey about personally  sensitive issues, they  might decline  to participate, and even if they do participate, they might choose to provide incorrect answers to  sensitive questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These problems induce  **selection**  biases that present challenges to interpreting and designing surveys.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate how social scientists have thought about estimating the prevalence of such embarrassing activities and opinions, this lecture describes a classic approach  of S. L. Warner {cite}`warner1965randomized`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warner  used elementary  probability to construct a  way to protect the privacy  of **individual** respondents to surveys while still    estimating  the fraction of a **collection** of individuals   who have a socially stigmatized characteristic or who engage in  a socially stigmatized activity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Warner's idea was to  add **noise** between the respondent's answer and the **signal** about that answer that the  survey maker ultimately receives. \n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing about the structure of the noise assures the respondent that the survey maker does not observe his answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical properties of the  noise injection procedure provide the respondent  **plausible deniability**.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Related ideas underlie  modern **differential privacy** systems.\n",
