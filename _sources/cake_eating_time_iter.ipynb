    "This approach differs from the value function iteration we used in\n",
    "{doc}`Cake Eating III <cake_eating_stochastic>`, where we iterated on the value function itself.\n",

    "Time iteration exploits the structure of the Euler equation to find the optimal\n",

    "policy function, we can often solve problems faster than with value function iteration.\n",
