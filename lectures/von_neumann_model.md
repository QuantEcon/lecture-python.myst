# Von Neumann Growth Model (and a Generalization)

```{contents} Contents
:depth: 2
```

This lecture uses the class `Neumann` to calculate key objects of a
linear growth model of John von Neumann {cite}`von1937uber` that was generalized by
Kemeny, Morgenstern and Thompson {cite}`kemeny1956generalization`.

Objects of interest are the maximal expansion rate ($\alpha$), the
interest factor ($β$), the optimal intensities ($x$), and
prices ($p$).

In addition to watching how the towering mind of John von Neumann
formulated an equilibrium model of price and quantity vectors in
balanced growth, this lecture shows how fruitfully to employ the
following important tools:

- a zero-sum two-player game
- linear programming
- the Perron-Frobenius theorem

We'll begin with some imports:

```{code-cell} ipython
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.optimize import fsolve, linprog
from textwrap import dedent
%matplotlib inline

np.set_printoptions(precision=2)
```

The code below provides the `Neumann` class

    """
    This class describes the Generalized von Neumann growth model as it was
    discussed in Kemeny et al. (1956, ECTA) and Gale (1960, Chapter 9.5):

    Let:
    n ... number of goods
    m ... number of activities
    A ... input matrix is m-by-n
        a_{i,j} - amount of good j consumed by activity i
    B ... output matrix is m-by-n
        b_{i,j} - amount of good j produced by activity i

    x ... intensity vector (m-vector) with non-negative entries
        x'B - the vector of goods produced
        x'A - the vector of goods consumed
    p ... price vector (n-vector) with non-negative entries
        Bp - the revenue vector for every activity
        Ap - the cost of each activity

    Both A and B have non-negative entries. Moreover, we assume that
    (1) Assumption I (every good which is consumed is also produced):
        for all j, b_{.,j} > 0, i.e. at least one entry is strictly positive
    (2) Assumption II (no free lunch):
        for all i, a_{i,.} > 0, i.e. at least one entry is strictly positive

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : array_like or scalar(float)
        Part of the state transition equation.  It should be `n x n`
    B : array_like or scalar(float)
        Part of the state transition equation.  It should be `n x k`

## Notation

We use the following notation.

$\mathbf{0}$ denotes
a vector of zeros.

We call an $n$-vector  positive and write
$x\gg \mathbf{0}$ if $x_i>0$ for all $i=1,2,\dots,n$.

We call a vector  non-negative and write $x\geq \mathbf{0}$ if $x_i\geq 0$ for
all $i=1,2,\dots,n$.

We call a vector  semi-positive and written $x > \mathbf{0}$ if
$x\geq \mathbf{0}$ and $x\neq \mathbf{0}$.

For two conformable vectors $x$ and $y$, $x\gg y$,
$x\geq y$ and $x> y$ mean $x-y\gg \mathbf{0}$,
$x-y \geq \mathbf{0}$, and $x-y > \mathbf{0}$, respectively.

We let all vectors in this lecture be column vectors; $x^{T}$ denotes the
transpose of $x$ (i.e., a row vector).

Let $\iota_n$ denote a
column vector composed of $n$ ones, i.e.
$\iota_n = (1,1,\dots,1)^T$.

Let $e^i$ denote a vector (of
arbitrary size) containing zeros except for the $i$ th position
where it is one.

We denote matrices by capital letters. For an arbitrary matrix
$A$, $a_{i,j}$ represents the entry in its $i$ th
row and $j$ th column.

$a_{\cdot j}$ and $a_{i\cdot}$
denote the $j$ th column and $i$ th row of $A$,
respectively.

## Model Ingredients and Assumptions

A pair $(A,B)$ of $m\times n$ non-negative matrices defines
an economy.

- $m$ is the number of *activities* (or sectors)
- $n$ is the number of *goods* (produced and/or consumed).
- $A$ is called the *input matrix*; $a_{i,j}$ denotes the
  amount of good $j$ consumed by activity $i$
- $B$ is called the *output matrix*; $b_{i,j}$ represents
  the amount of good $j$ produced by activity $i$

Two key assumptions restrict economy $(A,B)$:

- **Assumption I:** (every good that is consumed is also produced)

  $$
  b_{.,j} > \mathbf{0}\hspace{5mm}\forall j=1,2,\dots,n
  $$

- **Assumption II:** (no free lunch)

  $$
  a_{i,.} > \mathbf{0}\hspace{5mm}\forall i=1,2,\dots,m
  $$


A semi-positive  *intensity* $m$-vector  $x$ denotes  levels at which
activities are operated.

Therefore,

- vector $x^TA$ gives the total amount of *goods used in
  production*
- vector $x^TB$ gives *total outputs*

An economy $(A,B)$ is said to be *productive*, if there exists a
non-negative intensity vector $x \geq 0$ such
that $x^T B > x^TA$.

The semi-positive $n$-vector $p$ contains prices assigned to
the $n$ goods.

The $p$ vector implies *cost* and *revenue* vectors

- the vector $Ap$ tells *costs* of the vector of activities
- the vector $Bp$ tells *revenues* from the vector of activities

Satisfaction or a property of an input-output pair $(A,B)$ called *irreducibility*
(or indecomposability) determines whether an economy can be decomposed
into multiple     "sub-economies".

**Definition:** For an economy $(A,B)$, the set of goods
$S\subset \{1,2,\dots,n\}$ is called an *independent subset* if
it is possible to produce every good in $S$ without consuming
goods from outside $S$. Formally, the set $S$ is independent if
$\exists T\subset \{1,2,\dots,m\}$ (a subset of activities) such
that $a_{i,j}=0$ $\forall i\in T$ and $j\in S^c$ and
for all $j\in S$, $\exists i\in T$ for which  $b_{i,j}>0$.
The economy is **irreducible** if there are no proper independent
subsets.

We study two examples, both in  Chapter 9.6 of Gale {cite}`gale1989theory`

```{code-cell} python3
# (1) Irreducible (A, B) example: α_0 = β_0
A1 = np.array([[0, 1, 0, 0],
               [1, 0, 0, 1],
               [0, 0, 1, 0]])

B1 = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0],
               [0, 0, 2, 0],
               [0, 1, 0, 1]])

# (2) Reducible (A, B) example: β_0 < α_0
A2 = np.array([[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
               [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
               [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
               [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
               [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]])

B2 = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
               [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
               [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
               [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
               [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]])
```

The following code sets up our first Neumann economy or `Neumann`
instance

```{code-cell} python3
n1 = Neumann(A1, B1)
n1
```

Here is a second instance of a Neumann economy

```{code-cell} python3
n2 = Neumann(A2, B2)
n2
```

## Dynamic Interpretation

Attach a time index $t$ to the preceding objects, regard an economy
as a dynamic system, and study sequences

$$
\{(A_t,B_t)\}_{t\geq 0}, \hspace{1cm}\{x_t\}_{t\geq 0},\hspace{1cm} \{p_t\}_{t\geq 0}
$$

An interesting special case holds the technology process constant and
investigates the dynamics of quantities and prices only.

Accordingly, in the rest of this lecture, we assume that
$(A_t,B_t)=(A,B)$ for all $t\geq 0$.

A crucial element of the dynamic interpretation involves the timing of
production.

We assume that production (consumption of inputs) takes place in period
$t$, while the consequent output materializes in period
$t+1$, i.e., consumption of $x_{t}^TA$ in period $t$
results in $x^T_{t}B$ amounts of output in period $t+1$.

These timing conventions imply the following feasibility condition:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x^T_{t}B \geq x^T_{t+1} A \hspace{1cm}\forall t\geq 1
\end{aligned}
$$

which asserts that no more goods can be used today than were produced
yesterday.

Accordingly, $Ap_t$ tells the costs of production in period
$t$ and $Bp_t$ tells revenues in period $t+1$.

### Balanced Growth

We follow John von Neumann in studying “balanced growth”.

Let $./$ denote an elementwise division of one vector by another and let
$\alpha >0$ be a scalar.

Then *balanced growth* is a situation in which

$$
x_{t+1}./x_t = \alpha , \quad \forall t \geq 0
$$

With balanced growth, the law of motion of $x$ is evidently $x_{t+1}=\alpha x_t$
and so we can rewrite the feasibility constraint as

$$
x^T_{t}B \geq \alpha x^T_t A \hspace{1cm}\forall t
$$

In the same spirit, define $\beta\in\mathbb{R}$ as the **interest
factor** per unit of time.

We assume that it is always possible to earn a gross return equal to the
constant interest factor $\beta$ by investing “outside the model”.

Under this assumption about outside investment opportunities, a
no-arbitrage condition gives rise to the following (no profit)
restriction on the price sequence:

$$
\beta Ap_{t} \geq B p_{t} \hspace{1cm}\forall t
$$

This says that production cannot yield a return greater than that
offered by the outside investment opportunity (here we compare values in
period $t+1$).

The balanced growth assumption allows us to drop time subscripts and
conduct an analysis purely in terms of a time-invariant growth rate
$\alpha$ and interest factor $\beta$.

## Duality

Two problems are connected by a remarkable dual
relationship between  technological and valuation characteristics of
the economy:

**Definition:** The *technological expansion problem* (TEP) for the economy
$(A,B)$ is to find a semi-positive $m$-vector $x>0$
and a number $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy

$$
\begin{aligned}
    &\max_{\alpha} \hspace{2mm} \alpha\\
    &\text{s.t. }\hspace{2mm}x^T B \geq \alpha x^T A
    \end{aligned}
$$

Theorem 9.3 of David Gale’s book {cite}`gale1989theory` asserts that if Assumptions I and II are
both satisfied, then a maximum value of $\alpha$ exists and that it is
positive.

The maximal value is called the *technological expansion rate* and is denoted
by $\alpha_0$. The associated intensity vector $x_0$ is the
*optimal intensity vector*.

**Definition:** The economic expansion problem (EEP) for
$(A,B)$ is to find a semi-positive $n$-vector $p>0$
and a number $\beta\in\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy

$$
\begin{aligned}
    &\min_{\beta} \hspace{2mm} \beta\\
    &\text{s.t. }\hspace{2mm}Bp \leq \beta Ap
    \end{aligned}
$$

Assumptions I and II imply existence of a minimum value
$\beta_0>0$ called the *economic expansion rate*.

The corresponding price vector $p_0$ is the *optimal price vector*.

Because the criterion functions in the *technological expansion* problem
and the *economical expansion problem* are both linearly homogeneous,
the optimality of $x_0$ and $p_0$ are defined only up to a
positive scale factor.

For convenience (and to emphasize a close connection to zero-sum games),  we normalize both vectors
$x_0$ and $p_0$ to have unit length.

A standard duality argument (see Lemma 9.4. in (Gale, 1960) {cite}`gale1989theory`) implies
that under Assumptions I and II, $\beta_0\leq \alpha_0$.

But to deduce that $\beta_0\geq \alpha_0$,
Assumptions I and II are not sufficient.

Therefore, von Neumann {cite}`von1937uber`  went on to prove the following remarkable
“duality” result that connects TEP and EEP.

**Theorem 1 (von Neumann):** If the economy $(A,B)$ satisfies
Assumptions I and II, then there exist
$\left(\gamma^{*}, x_0, p_0\right)$, where
$\gamma^{*}\in[\beta_0, \alpha_0]\subset\mathbb{R}$, $x_0>0$
is an $m$-vector, $p_0>0$ is an $n$-vector, and the
following arbitrage true

$$
\begin{aligned}
x_0^T B &\geq \gamma^{* } x_0^T A \\
Bp_0 &\leq \gamma^{* } Ap_0 \\
x_0^T\left(B-\gamma^{* } A\right)p_0 &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$

```{note}
*Proof (Sketch):* Assumption I and II imply that there exist $(\alpha_0,
x_0)$ and $(\beta_0, p_0)$ that solve the TEP and EEP, respectively. If
$\gamma^*>\alpha_0$, then by definition of $\alpha_0$, there cannot
exist a semi-positive $x$ that satisfies $x^T B \geq \gamma^{* }
x^T A$.  Similarly, if $\gamma^*<\beta_0$, there is no semi-positive
$p$ for which $Bp \leq \gamma^{* } Ap$. Let $\gamma^{*
}\in[\beta_0, \alpha_0]$, then $x_0^T B \geq \alpha_0 x_0^T A \geq
\gamma^{* } x_0^T A$.  Moreover, $Bp_0\leq \beta_0 A p_0\leq \gamma^* A
p_0$. These two inequalities imply $x_0\left(B - \gamma^{* } A\right)p_0
= 0$.
```

Here the constant $\gamma^{*}$ is both an expansion factor  and an interest
factor (not necessarily optimal).

We have already encountered and
discussed the first two inequalities that represent feasibility and
no-profit conditions.

Moreover, the equality $x_0^T\left(B-\gamma^{* } A\right)p_0 = 0$ concisely expresses the
requirements that if any good grows at a rate larger than
$\gamma^{*}$ (i.e., if it is *oversupplied*), then its price
must be zero; and that if any activity provides negative profit, it must
be unused.

Therefore, the conditions stated in Theorem I ex encode all equilibrium conditions.

So  Theorem I essentially states that under Assumptions I and II there
always exists an equilibrium $\left(\gamma^{*}, x_0, p_0\right)$
with balanced growth.

Note that Theorem I is silent about uniqueness of the equilibrium. In
fact, it does not rule out (trivial) cases with $x_0^TBp_0 = 0$ so
that nothing of value is produced.

To exclude such uninteresting cases,
Kemeny, Morgenstern and Thomspson {cite}`kemeny1956generalization` add an extra requirement

$$
x^T_0 B p_0 > 0
$$

and call the associated equilibria *economic solutions*.

They show that
this extra condition does not affect the existence result, while it
significantly reduces the number of (relevant) solutions.

## Interpretation as Two-player Zero-sum Game

To compute the equilibrium $(\gamma^{*}, x_0, p_0)$, we follow the
algorithm proposed by Hamburger, Thompson and Weil (1967), building on
the key insight that an equilibrium (with balanced growth) can be
solves a particular two-player zero-sum game.
First, we introduce some notation.

Consider the $m\times n$ matrix $C$ as a payoff matrix,
with the entries representing payoffs from the **minimizing** column
player to the **maximizing** row player and assume that the players can
use mixed strategies. Thus,

* the  row player chooses the $m$-vector $x > \mathbf{0}$ subject to $\iota_m^T x = 1$
* the column player chooses the $n$-vector $p > \mathbf{0}$ subject to $\iota_n^T p = 1$.

**Definition:** The $m\times n$ matrix game $C$ has the
*solution* $(x^*, p^*, V(C))$ in mixed strategies if

$$
\begin{aligned}
(x^* )^T C e^j \geq V(C)\quad \forall j\in\{1, \dots, n\}\quad \quad
\text{and}\quad\quad (e^i)^T C p^* \leq V(C)\quad \forall i\in\{1, \dots, m\}
\end{aligned}
$$

The number $V(C)$ is called the *value* of the game.

From the above definition, it is clear that the value $V(C)$ has
two alternative interpretations:

* by playing the appropriate mixed
  stategy, the maximizing player can assure himself at least $V(C)$
  (no matter what the column player chooses)
* by playing the appropriate
  mixed stategy, the minimizing player can make sure that the maximizing
  player will not get more than $V(C)$ (irrespective of what is the
  maximizing player’s choice)

A famous theorem of Nash (1951) tells us that there always
exists a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for any *finite* two-player
zero-sum game.

Moreover, von Neumann’s Minmax Theorem {cite}`neumann1928theorie` implies that

$$
V(C) = \max_x \min_p \hspace{2mm} x^T C p = \min_p \max_x \hspace{2mm} x^T C p = (x^*)^T C p^*
$$

### Connection with Linear Programming (LP)

Nash equilibria of a finite two-player zero-sum game solve  a linear programming problem.

To see this, we introduce
the following notation

* For a fixed $x$, let $v$ be the value of the minimization problem: $v \equiv \min_p x^T C p = \min_j x^T C e^j$
* For a fixed $p$, let $u$ be the value of the maximization problem: $u \equiv \max_x x^T C p = \max_i (e^i)^T C p$

Then the *max-min problem* (the game from the maximizing player’s point
of view) can be written as the *primal* LP

$$
\begin{aligned}
V(C) = & \max \hspace{2mm} v \\
\text{s.t. } \hspace{2mm} v \iota_n^T &\leq x^T C  \\
x &\geq \mathbf{0} \\
\iota_n^T x & = 1
\end{aligned}
$$

while the *min-max problem* (the game from the minimizing player’s point
of view) is the *dual* LP

$$
\begin{aligned}
V(C) = &\min \hspace{2mm} u \\
\text{s.t. } \hspace{2mm}u \iota_m &\geq Cp  \\
p &\geq \mathbf{0} \\
\iota_m^T p & = 1
\end{aligned}
$$

Hamburger, Thompson and Weil {cite}`hamburger1967computation` view the input-output pair of the
economy as payoff matrices of two-player zero-sum games.

Using this interpretation, they restate Assumption I and II as follows

$$
V(-A) < 0\quad\quad \text{and}\quad\quad V(B)>0
$$

```{note}
*Proof (Sketch)*:
* $\Rightarrow$ $V(B)>0$ implies
$x_0^T B \gg \mathbf{0}$, where $x_0$ is a maximizing
vector. Since $B$ is non-negative, this requires that each
column of $B$ has at least one positive entry, which is
Assumption I.
* $\Leftarrow$ From Assumption I and the fact
that $p>\mathbf{0}$, it follows that $Bp > \mathbf{0}$.
This implies that the maximizing player can always choose $x$
so that $x^TBp>0$ so that it must be the case
that $V(B)>0$.
```

In order to (re)state Theorem I in terms of a particular two-player
zero-sum game, we define a matrix for $\gamma\in\mathbb{R}$

$$
M(\gamma) \equiv B - \gamma A
$$

For fixed $\gamma$, treating $M(\gamma)$ as a matrix game,
calculating the solution of the game implies

- If $\gamma > \alpha_0$, then for all $x>0$, there
  $\exists j\in\{1, \dots, n\}$, s.t.
  $[x^T M(\gamma)]_j < 0$ implying
  that $V(M(\gamma)) < 0$.
- If $\gamma < \beta_0$, then for all $p>0$, there
  $\exists i\in\{1, \dots, m\}$, s.t.
  $[M(\gamma)p]_i > 0$ implying that $V(M(\gamma)) > 0$.
- If $\gamma \in \{\beta_0, \alpha_0\}$, then (by Theorem I) the
  optimal intensity and price vectors $x_0$ and $p_0$
  satisfy

$$
\begin{aligned}
x_0^T M(\gamma) \geq \mathbf{0}^T \quad \quad \text{and}\quad\quad M(\gamma) p_0 \leq \mathbf{0}
\end{aligned}
$$

That is, $(x_0, p_0, 0)$ is a solution of the game
$M(\gamma)$ so
that $V\left(M(\beta_0)\right) = V\left(M(\alpha_0)\right) = 0$.

* If $\beta_0 < \alpha_0$ and
$\gamma \in (\beta_0, \alpha_0)$, then $V(M(\gamma)) = 0$.

Moreover, if $x'$ is optimal for the maximizing player in
$M(\gamma')$ for $\gamma'\in(\beta_0, \alpha_0)$ and
$p''$ is optimal for the minimizing player in $M(\gamma'')$
where $\gamma''\in(\beta_0, \gamma')$, then $(x', p'', 0)$
is a solution for $M(\gamma)$ $\forall \gamma\in (\gamma'', \gamma')$.

*Proof (Sketch):* If $x'$ is optimal for a maximizing player in
game $M(\gamma')$, then $(x')^T M(\gamma')\geq \mathbf{0}^T$ and so for all $\gamma<\gamma'$.

$$
(x')^T M(\gamma) = (x')^T M(\gamma') + (x')^T(\gamma' - \gamma)A \geq \mathbf{0}^T
$$

hence $V(M(\gamma))\geq 0$. If $p''$ is optimal for a
minimizing player in game $M(\gamma'')$, then $M(\gamma)p \leq \mathbf{0}$
and so for all $\gamma''<\gamma$

$$
M(\gamma)p'' = M(\gamma'') + (\gamma'' - \gamma)Ap'' \leq \mathbf{0}
$$

hence $V(M(\gamma))\leq 0$.

It is clear from the above argument that $\beta_0$, $\alpha_0$ are the minimal and maximal $\gamma$ for which
$V(M(\gamma))=0$.

Furthermore, Hamburger et al. {cite}`hamburger1967computation` show that the
function $\gamma \mapsto V(M(\gamma))$ is continuous and
nonincreasing in $\gamma$.

This suggests an algorithm to compute
$(\alpha_0, x_0)$ and $(\beta_0, p_0)$ for a given
input-output pair $(A, B)$.

### Algorithm

Hamburger, Thompson and Weil {cite}`hamburger1967computation` propose a simple bisection algorithm
to find the minimal and maximal roots (i.e. $\beta_0$ and
$\alpha_0$) of the function $\gamma \mapsto V(M(\gamma))$.

#### Step 1

First, notice that we can easily find trivial upper and lower bounds for
$\alpha_0$ and $\beta_0$.

* TEP requires that
$x^T(B-\alpha A)\geq \mathbf{0}^T$ and $x > \mathbf{0}$, so
if $\alpha$ is so large that
$\max_i\{[(B-\alpha A)\iota_n]_i\} < 0$, then TEP ceases to have a
solution.

Accordingly, let **``UB``** be the $\alpha^{*}$ that
solves $\max_i\{[(B-\alpha^{*} A)\iota_n]_i\} = 0$.

* Similar to
the upper bound, if $\beta$ is so low that
$\min_j\{[\iota^T_m(B-\beta A)]_j\}>0$, then the EEP has no
solution and so we can define **``LB``** as the $\beta^{*}$ that
solves $\min_j\{[\iota^T_m(B-\beta^{*} A)]_j\}=0$.

The *bounds* method calculates these trivial bounds for us

```{code-cell} python3
n1.bounds()
```

#### Step 2

Compute $\alpha_0$ and $\beta_0$

- Finding $\alpha_0$
    1. Fix $\gamma = \frac{UB + LB}{2}$ and compute the solution
       of the two-player zero-sum game associated
       with $M(\gamma)$. We can use either the primal or the dual
       LP problem.
    1. If $V(M(\gamma)) \geq 0$, then set $LB = \gamma$,
       otherwise let $UB = \gamma$.
    1. Iterate on 1. and 2. until $|UB - LB| < \epsilon$.
- Finding $\beta_0$
    1. Fix $\gamma = \frac{UB + LB}{2}$ and compute the solution
       of the two-player zero-sum game associated.
       with $M(\gamma)$. We can use either the primal or the dual
       LP problem.
    1. If $V(M(\gamma)) > 0$, then set $LB = \gamma$,
       otherwise let $UB = \gamma$.
    1. Iterate on 1. and 2. until $|UB - LB| < \epsilon$.
- *Existence*: Since $V(M(LB))>0$ and $V(M(UB))<0$ and
  $V(M(\cdot))$ is a continuous, nonincreasing function, there is
  at least one $\gamma\in[LB, UB]$, s.t. $V(M(\gamma))=0$.

The *zerosum* method calculates the value and optimal strategies
associated with a given $\gamma$.

```{code-cell} python3
γ = 2

print(f'Value of the game with γ = {γ}')
print(n1.zerosum(γ=γ)[0])
print('Intensity vector (from the primal)')
print(n1.zerosum(γ=γ)[1])
print('Price vector (from the dual)')
print(n1.zerosum(γ=γ, dual=True)[1])
```

```{code-cell} python3
numb_grid = 100
γ_grid = np.linspace(0.4, 2.1, numb_grid)

value_ex1_grid = np.asarray([n1.zerosum(γ=γ_grid[i])[0]
                            for i in range(numb_grid)])
value_ex2_grid = np.asarray([n2.zerosum(γ=γ_grid[i])[0]
                            for i in range(numb_grid)])

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(14, 5), sharey=True)
fig.suptitle(r'The function $V(M(\gamma))$', fontsize=16)

for ax, grid, N, i in zip(axes, (value_ex1_grid, value_ex2_grid),
                          (n1, n2), (1, 2)):
    ax.plot(γ_grid, grid)
    ax.set(title=f'Example {i}', xlabel='$\gamma$')
    ax.axhline(0, c='k', lw=1)
    ax.axvline(N.bounds()[0], c='r', ls='--', label='lower bound')
    ax.axvline(N.bounds()[1], c='g', ls='--', label='upper bound')

plt.show()
```

The *expansion* method implements the bisection algorithm for
$\alpha_0$ (and uses the primal LP problem for $x_0$)

```{code-cell} python3
α_0, x, p = n1.expansion()
print(f'α_0 = {α_0}')
print(f'x_0 = {x}')
print(f'The corresponding p from the dual = {p}')
```

The *interest* method implements the bisection algorithm for
$\beta_0$ (and uses the dual LP problem for $p_0$)

```{code-cell} python3
β_0, x, p = n1.interest()
print(f'β_0 = {β_0}')
print(f'p_0 = {p}')
print(f'The corresponding x from the primal = {x}')
```

Of course, when $\gamma^*$ is unique, it is irrelevant which one of the two methods we use  -- both work.

In particular, as will be shown below, in
case of an irreducible $(A,B)$ (like in Example 1), the maximal
and minimal roots of $V(M(\gamma))$ necessarily coincide implying
a ‘‘full duality’’ result, i.e. $\alpha_0 = \beta_0 = \gamma^*$ so that the expansion (and interest) rate $\gamma^*$ is unique.

### Uniqueness and Irreducibility

As an illustration, compute first the maximal and minimal roots of
$V(M(\cdot))$ for our Example 2 that has a reducible
input-output pair $(A, B)$

```{code-cell} python3
α_0, x, p = n2.expansion()
print(f'α_0 = {α_0}')
print(f'x_0 = {x}')
print(f'The corresponding p from the dual = {p}')
```

```{code-cell} python3
β_0, x, p = n2.interest()
print(f'β_0 = {β_0}')
print(f'p_0 = {p}')
print(f'The corresponding x from the primal = {x}')
```

As we can see, with a reducible $(A,B)$, the roots found by the
bisection algorithms might differ, so there might be multiple
$\gamma^*$ that make the value of the game
with $M(\gamma^*)$ zero. (see the figure above).

Indeed, although the von Neumann theorem assures existence of the
equilibrium, Assumptions I and II are not sufficient for uniqueness.
Nonetheless, Kemeny et al. (1967) show that there are at most finitely
many economic solutions, meaning that there are only finitely many
$\gamma^*$ that satisfy $V(M(\gamma^*)) = 0$ and
$x_0^TBp_0 > 0$ and that for each such $\gamma^*_i$, there
is a self-contained part of the economy (a sub-economy) that in
equilibrium can expand independently with the expansion
coefficient $\gamma^*_i$.

The following theorem (see Theorem 9.10. in Gale {cite}`gale1989theory`) asserts that
imposing irreducibility is sufficient for uniqueness of
$(\gamma^*, x_0, p_0)$.

**Theorem II:** Adopt the conditions of Theorem 1. If the economy
$(A,B)$ is irreducible, then $\gamma^*=\alpha_0=\beta_0$.

### A Special Case

There is a special $(A,B)$ that allows us to simplify the solution
method significantly by invoking the powerful Perron-Frobenius theorem
for non-negative matrices.

**Definition:** We call an economy *simple* if it satisfies

* $n=m$
* Each activity produces exactly one good
* Each good is produced by one and only one activity.

These assumptions imply that $B=I_n$, i.e., that $B$ can be
written as an identity matrix (possibly after reshuffling its rows and
columns).

The simple model has the following special property (Theorem 9.11. in Gale {cite}`gale1989theory`): if $x_0$ and $\alpha_0>0$ solve the TEP
with $(A,I_n)$, then

$$
x_0^T = \alpha_0 x_0^T A\hspace{1cm}\Leftrightarrow\hspace{1cm}x_0^T
A=\left(\frac{1}{\alpha_0}\right)x_0^T
$$

The latter shows that $1/\alpha_0$ is a positive eigenvalue of
$A$ and $x_0$ is the corresponding non-negative left
eigenvector.

The classic result of **Perron and Frobenius** implies
that a non-negative matrix  has a non-negative
eigenvalue-eigenvector pair.

Moreover, if $A$ is irreducible, then
the optimal intensity vector $x_0$ is positive and *unique* up to
multiplication by a positive scalar.

Suppose that $A$ is reducible with $k$ irreducible subsets
$S_1,\dots,S_k$. Let $A_i$ be the submatrix corresponding to
$S_i$ and let $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_i$ be the
associated expansion and interest factors, respectively. Then we have

$$
\alpha_0 = \max_i \{\alpha_i\}\hspace{1cm}\text{and}\hspace{1cm}\beta_0 = \min_i \{\beta_i\}
$$
