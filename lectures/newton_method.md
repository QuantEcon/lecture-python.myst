# Using Newton's Method to Solve Economic Models

```{contents} Contents

**GPU:** A version of this lecture which makes use of [jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io) to run the code
on a `GPU` is [available here](https://jax.quantecon.org/newtons_method.html)
```

## Overview

Many economic problems involve finding [fixed
points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_(mathematics)) or
[zeros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_of_a_function) (sometimes called
"roots") of functions.

For example, in a simple supply and demand model, an equilibrium price is one
that makes excess demand zero.  

In other words, an equilibrium is a zero of the excess demand function.

There are various computational techniques for solving for fixed points and
zeros.

In this lecture we study an important gradient-based technique called [Newton's
method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method).

Newton's method does not always work but, in situations where it does,
convergence is often fast when compared to other methods.

The lecture will apply Newton's method in one-dimensional and
multi-dimensional settings to solve fixed-point and zero-finding problems. 

* When finding the fixed point of a function $f$, Newton's method updates
  an existing guess of the fixed point by solving for the fixed point of a
  linear approximation to the function $f$.

* When finding the zero of a function $f$, Newton's method updates
  an existing guess by solving for the zero of a linear approximation to
  the function $f$.

To build intuition, we first consider an easy, one-dimensional fixed point
problem where we know the solution and solve it using both successive
approximation and Newton's method.

Then we apply Newton's method to multi-dimensional settings to solve
market for equilibria with multiple goods.

At the end of the lecture we leverage the power of automatic
differentiation in [`autograd`](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd) to solve a very high-dimensional equilibrium problem

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-output]

!pip install autograd
```

We use the following imports in this lecture

```{code-cell} ipython3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from collections import namedtuple
from scipy.optimize import root
from autograd import jacobian
# Thinly-wrapped numpy to enable automatic differentiation
import autograd.numpy as np

plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = (10, 5.7)
```

## Fixed Point Computation Using Newton's Method

In this section we solve the fixed point of the law of motion for capital in
the setting of the [Solow growth
model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solow%E2%80%93Swan_model).

We will inspect the fixed point visually, solve it by successive
approximation, and then apply Newton's method to achieve faster convergence.

(solow)=
### The Solow Model

In the Solow growth model, assuming Cobb-Douglas production technology and
zero population growth, the law of motion for capital is

```{math}
:label: motion_law
    k_{t+1} = g(k_t) \quad \text{where} \quad
    g(k) := sAk^\alpha + (1-\delta) k
```

Here

- $k_t$ is capital stock per worker,
- $A, \alpha>0$ are production parameters, $\alpha<1$
- $s>0$ is a savings rate, and
- $\delta \in(0,1)$ is a rate of depreciation

In this example, we wish to calculate the unique strictly positive fixed point
of $g$, the law of motion for capital.

In other words, we seek a $k^* > 0$ such that $g(k^*)=k^*$.

* such a $k^*$ is called a [steady state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady_state),
  since $k_t = k^*$ implies $k_{t+1} = k^*$.

Using pencil and paper to solve $g(k)=k$, you will be able to confirm that

$$ k^* = \left(\frac{s A}{δ}\right)^{1/(1 - α)}  $$

### Implementation

Let's store our parameters in [`namedtuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple) to help us keep our code clean and concise.

```{code-cell} ipython3
SolowParameters = namedtuple("SolowParameters", ('A', 's', 'α', 'δ'))
```

This function creates a suitable `namedtuple` with default parameter values.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def create_solow_params(A=2.0, s=0.3, α=0.3, δ=0.4):
    "Creates a Solow model parameterization with default values."
    return SolowParameters(A=A, s=s, α=α, δ=δ)
```

The next two functions implement the law of motion [](motion_law) and store the true fixed point $k^*$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def g(k, params):
    A, s, α, δ = params
    return A * s * k**α + (1 - δ) * k
    
def exact_fixed_point(params):
    A, s, α, δ = params
    return ((s * A) / δ)**(1/(1 - α))
```

Here is a function to provide a 45 degree plot of the dynamics.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def plot_45(params, ax, fontsize=14):
    
    k_min, k_max = 0.0, 3.0
    k_grid = np.linspace(k_min, k_max, 1200)

    # Plot the functions
    lb = r"$g(k) = sAk^{\alpha} + (1 - \delta)k$"
    ax.plot(k_grid, g(k_grid, params),  lw=2, alpha=0.6, label=lb)
    ax.plot(k_grid, k_grid, "k--", lw=1, alpha=0.7, label="45")

    # Show and annotate the fixed point
    kstar = exact_fixed_point(params)
    fps = (kstar,)
    ax.plot(fps, fps, "go", ms=10, alpha=0.6)
    ax.annotate(r"$k^* = (sA / \delta)^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}}$", 
             xy=(kstar, kstar),
             xycoords="data",
             xytext=(20, -20),
             textcoords="offset points",
             fontsize=fontsize)

    ax.legend(loc="upper left", frameon=False, fontsize=fontsize)

    ax.set_yticks((0, 1, 2, 3))
    ax.set_yticklabels((0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0), fontsize=fontsize)
    ax.set_ylim(0, 3)
    ax.set_xlabel("$k_t$", fontsize=fontsize)
    ax.set_ylabel("$k_{t+1}$", fontsize=fontsize)
```

Let's look at the 45 degree diagram for two parameterizations.

```{code-cell} ipython3
params = create_solow_params()
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 8))
plot_45(params, ax)
plt.show()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
params = create_solow_params(α=0.05, δ=0.5)
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 8))
plot_45(params, ax)
plt.show()
```

We see that $k^*$ is indeed the unique positive fixed point.


#### Successive Approximation

First let's compute the fixed point using successive approximation.

In this case, successive approximation means repeatedly updating capital
from some initial state $k_0$ using the law of motion.

Here's a time series from a particular choice of $k_0$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def compute_iterates(k_0, f, params, n=25):
    "Compute time series of length n generated by arbitrary function f."
    k = k_0
    k_iterates = []
    for t in range(n):
        k_iterates.append(k)
        k = f(k, params)
    return k_iterates
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
params = create_solow_params()
k_0 = 0.25
k_series = compute_iterates(k_0, g, params)
k_star = exact_fixed_point(params)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(k_series, 'o')
ax.plot([k_star] * len(k_series), 'k--')
ax.set_ylim(0, 3)
plt.show()
```

Let's see the output for a long time series.

```{code-cell} ipython3
k_series = compute_iterates(k_0, g, params, n=10_000)
k_star_approx = k_series[-1]
k_star_approx
```

This is close to the true value.

(solved_k)=

```{code-cell} ipython3
k_star
```

#### Newton's Method 

In general, when applying Newton's fixed point method to some function $g$, 
we start with a guess $x_0$ of the fixed
point and then update by solving for the fixed point of a tangent line at
$x_0$.

To begin with, we recall that the first-order approximation of $g$ at $x_0$
(i.e., the first order Taylor approximation of $g$ at $x_0$) is
the function

```{math}
:label: motivation

\hat g(x) \approx g(x_0)+g'(x_0)(x-x_0)
```

We solve for the fixed point of $\hat g$ by calculating the $x_1$ that solves

$$
x_1=\frac{g(x_0)-g'(x_0) x_0}{1-g'(x_0)}
$$

Generalising the process above, Newton's fixed point method iterates on 

```{math}
:label: newtons_method

x_{t+1} = \frac{g(x_t) - g'(x_t) x_t}{ 1 - g'(x_t) },
\quad x_0 \text{ given}
```


To implement Newton's method we observe that the derivative of the law of motion for capital [](motion_law) is

```{math}
:label: newton_method2

g'(k) = \alpha s A k^{\alpha-1} + (1-\delta)

```

Let's define this:

```{code-cell} ipython3
def Dg(k, params):
    A, s, α, δ = params
    return α * A * s * k**(α-1) + (1 - δ)
```

Here's a function $q$ representing [](newtons_method).

```{code-cell} ipython3
def q(k, params):
    return (g(k, params) - Dg(k, params) * k) / (1 - Dg(k, params))
```

Now let's plot some trajectories.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def plot_trajectories(params, 
                      k0_a=0.8,  # first initial condition
                      k0_b=3.1,  # second initial condition
                      n=20,      # length of time series
                      fs=14):    # fontsize

    fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(10, 6))
    ax1, ax2 = axes

    ks1 = compute_iterates(k0_a, g, params, n)
    ax1.plot(ks1, "-o", label="successive approximation")

    ks2 = compute_iterates(k0_b, g, params, n)
    ax2.plot(ks2, "-o", label="successive approximation")

    ks3 = compute_iterates(k0_a, q, params, n)
    ax1.plot(ks3, "-o", label="newton steps")

    ks4 = compute_iterates(k0_b, q, params, n)
    ax2.plot(ks4, "-o", label="newton steps")

    for ax in axes:
        ax.plot(k_star * np.ones(n), "k--")
        ax.legend(fontsize=fs, frameon=False)
        ax.set_ylim(0.6, 3.2)
        ax.set_yticks((k_star,))
        ax.set_yticklabels(("$k^*$",), fontsize=fs)
        ax.set_xticks(np.linspace(0, 19, 20))
        
    plt.show()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
params = create_solow_params()
plot_trajectories(params)
```

We can see that Newton's method converges faster than successive approximation.


## Root-Finding in One Dimension

In the previous section we computed fixed points.

In fact Newton's method is more commonly associated with the problem of
finding zeros of functions.

Let's discuss this "root-finding" problem and then show how it is connected to
the problem of finding fixed points.



### Newton's Method for Zeros

Let's suppose we want to find an $x$ such that $f(x)=0$ for some smooth
function $f$ mapping real numbers to real numbers.

Suppose we have a guess $x_0$ and we want to update it to a new point $x_1$.

As a first step, we take the first-order approximation of $f$ around $x_0$:

$$
\hat f(x) \approx f\left(x_0\right)+f^{\prime}\left(x_0\right)\left(x-x_0\right)
$$

Now we solve for the zero of $\hat f$.  

In particular, we set $\hat{f}(x_1) = 0$ and solve for $x_1$ to get

$$
x_1 = x_0 - \frac{ f(x_0) }{ f'(x_0) },
\quad x_0 \text{ given}
$$

Generalizing the formula above, for one-dimensional zero-finding problems, Newton's method iterates on

```{math}
:label: oneD-newton
x_{t+1} = x_t - \frac{ f(x_t) }{ f'(x_t) },
\quad x_0 \text{ given}
```

The following code implements the iteration [](oneD-newton)

(first_newton_attempt)=

```{code-cell} ipython3
def newton(f, Df, x_0, tol=1e-7, max_iter=100_000):
    x = x_0

    # Implement the zero-finding formula
    def q(x):
        return x - f(x) / Df(x)

    error = tol + 1
    n = 0
    while error > tol:
        n += 1
        if(n > max_iter):
            raise Exception('Max iteration reached without convergence')
        y = q(x)
        error = np.abs(x - y)
        x = y
        print(f'iteration {n}, error = {error:.5f}')
    return x
```

Numerous libraries implement Newton's method in one dimension, including
SciPy, so the code is just for illustrative purposes.

(That said, when we want to apply Newton's method using techniques such as
automatic differentiation or GPU acceleration, it will be helpful to know how
to implement Newton's method ourselves.)


### Application to Finding Fixed Points

Now consider again the Solow fixed-point calculation, where we solve for $k$
satisfying $g(k) = k$.

We can convert to this to a zero-finding problem by setting $f(x) := g(x)-x$.

Any zero of $f$ is clearly a fixed point of $g$.

Let's apply this idea to the Solow problem

```{code-cell} ipython3
params = create_solow_params()
k_star_approx_newton = newton(f=lambda x: g(x, params) - x,
                              Df=lambda x: Dg(x, params) - 1,
                              x_0=0.8)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
k_star_approx_newton
```

The result confirms the descent we saw in the graphs above: a very accurate result is reached with only 5 iterations.



## Multivariate Newton’s Method

In this section, we introduce a two-good problem, present a
visualization of the problem, and solve for the equilibrium of the two-good market
using both a zero finder in `SciPy` and Newton's method.

We then expand the idea to a larger market with 5,000 goods and compare the
performance of the two methods again.

We will see a significant performance gain when using Netwon's method.


(two_goods_market)=
### A Two Goods Market Equilibrium

Let's start by computing the market equilibrium of a two-good problem.

We consider a market for two related products, good 0 and good 1, with
price vector $p = (p_0, p_1)$

Supply of good $i$ at price $p$,

$$ 
q^s_i (p) = b_i \sqrt{p_i} 
$$

Demand of good $i$ at price $p$ is,

$$ 
q^d_i (p) = \exp(-(a_{i0} p_0 + a_{i1} p_1)) + c_i
$$

Here $c_i$, $b_i$ and $a_{ij}$ are parameters.

For example, the two goods might be computer components that are typically used together, in which case they are complements. Hence demand depends on the price of both components.

The excess demand function is,

$$
e_i(p) = q^d_i(p) - q^s_i(p), \quad i = 0, 1
$$


An equilibrium price vector $p^*$ satisfies $e_i(p^*) = 0$.


We set

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
            a_{00} & a_{01} \\
            a_{10} & a_{11}
        \end{pmatrix},
            \qquad 
    b = \begin{pmatrix}
            b_0 \\
            b_1
        \end{pmatrix}
    \qquad \text{and} \qquad
    c = \begin{pmatrix}
            c_0 \\
            c_1
        \end{pmatrix}
$$

for this particular question.

#### A Graphical Exploration

Since our problem is only two-dimensional, we can use graphical analysis to visualize and help understand the problem.

Our first step is to define the excess demand function

$$
e(p) = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
    e_0(p) \\
    e_1(p)
    \end{pmatrix}
$$

The function below calculates the excess demand for given parameters

```{code-cell} ipython3
def e(p, A, b, c):
    return np.exp(- A @ p) + c - b * np.sqrt(p)
```

Our default parameter values will be


$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
            0.5 & 0.4 \\
            0.8 & 0.2
        \end{pmatrix},
            \qquad 
    b = \begin{pmatrix}
            1 \\
            1
        \end{pmatrix}
    \qquad \text{and} \qquad
    c = \begin{pmatrix}
            1 \\
            1
        \end{pmatrix}
$$

```{code-cell} ipython3
A = np.array([
    [0.5, 0.4],
    [0.8, 0.2]
])
b = np.ones(2)
c = np.ones(2)
```

At a price level of $p = (1, 0.5)$, the excess demand is

```{code-cell} ipython3
ex_demand = e((1.0, 0.5), A, b, c)

print(f'The excess demand for good 0 is {ex_demand[0]:.3f} \n'
      f'The excess demand for good 1 is {ex_demand[1]:.3f}')
```

Next we plot the two functions $e_0$ and $e_1$ on a grid of $(p_0, p_1)$ values, using contour surfaces and lines.

We will use the following function to build the contour plots

```{code-cell} ipython3
def plot_excess_demand(ax, good=0, grid_size=100, grid_max=4, surface=True):

    # Create a 100x100 grid
    p_grid = np.linspace(0, grid_max, grid_size)
    z = np.empty((100, 100))

    for i, p_1 in enumerate(p_grid):
        for j, p_2 in enumerate(p_grid):
            z[i, j] = e((p_1, p_2), A, b, c)[good]

    if surface:
        cs1 = ax.contourf(p_grid, p_grid, z.T, alpha=0.5)
        plt.colorbar(cs1, ax=ax, format="%.6f")

    ctr1 = ax.contour(p_grid, p_grid, z.T, levels=[0.0])
    ax.set_xlabel("$p_0$")
    ax.set_ylabel("$p_1$")
    ax.set_title(f'Excess Demand for Good {good}')
    plt.clabel(ctr1, inline=1, fontsize=13)
```

Here's our plot of $e_0$:

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plot_excess_demand(ax, good=0)
plt.show()
```

Here's our plot of $e_1$:

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plot_excess_demand(ax, good=1)
plt.show()
```

We see the black contour line of zero, which tells us when $e_i(p)=0$.

For a price vector $p$ such that $e_i(p)=0$ we know that good $i$ is in equilibrium (demand equals supply).

If these two contour lines cross at some price vector $p^*$, then $p^*$ is an equilibrium price vector.

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 5.7))
for good in (0, 1):
    plot_excess_demand(ax, good=good, surface=False)
plt.show()
```

It seems there is an equilibrium close to $p = (1.6, 1.5)$.


#### Using a Multidimensional Root Finder

To solve for $p^*$ more precisely, we use a zero-finding algorithm from `scipy.optimize`.

We supply $p = (1, 1)$ as our initial guess.

```{code-cell} ipython3
init_p = np.ones(2)
```

This uses the [modified Powell method](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.root-hybr.html#optimize-root-hybr) to find the zero

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%time
solution = root(lambda p: e(p, A, b, c), init_p, method='hybr')
```

Here's the resulting value:

```{code-cell} ipython3
p = solution.x
p
```

This looks close to our guess from observing the figure. We can plug it back into $e$ to test that $e(p) \approx 0$:

```{code-cell} ipython3
np.max(np.abs(e(p, A, b, c)))
```

This is indeed a very small error.


#### Adding Gradient Information

In many cases, for zero-finding algorithms applied to smooth functions, supplying the [Jacobian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant) of the function leads to better convergence properties.

Here we manually calculate the elements of the Jacobian

$$
J(p) = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \frac{\partial e_0}{\partial p_0}(p) & \frac{\partial e_0}{\partial p_1}(p) \\
        \frac{\partial e_1}{\partial p_0}(p) & \frac{\partial e_1}{\partial p_1}(p)
    \end{pmatrix}
$$

```{code-cell} ipython3
def jacobian_e(p, A, b, c):
    p_0, p_1 = p
    a_00, a_01 = A[0, :]
    a_10, a_11 = A[1, :]
    j_00 = -a_00 * np.exp(-a_00 * p_0) - (b[0]/2) * p_0**(-1/2)
    j_01 = -a_01 * np.exp(-a_01 * p_1)
    j_10 = -a_10 * np.exp(-a_10 * p_0)
    j_11 = -a_11 * np.exp(-a_11 * p_1) - (b[1]/2) * p_1**(-1/2)
    J = [[j_00, j_01],
         [j_10, j_11]]
    return np.array(J)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%time
solution = root(lambda p: e(p, A, b, c),
                init_p, 
                jac=lambda p: jacobian_e(p, A, b, c), 
                method='hybr')
```

Now the solution is even more accurate (although, in this low-dimensional problem, the difference is quite small):

```{code-cell} ipython3
p = solution.x
np.max(np.abs(e(p, A, b, c)))
```

#### Using Newton's Method

Now let's use Newton's method to compute the equilibrium price using the multivariate version of Newton's method

```{math}
:label: multi-newton

p_{n+1} = p_n - J_e(p_n)^{-1} e(p_n)
```

This is a multivariate version of [](oneD-newton)

(Here $J_e(p_n)$ is the Jacobian of $e$ evaluated at $p_n$.)

The iteration starts from some initial guess of the price vector $p_0$. 

Here, instead of coding Jacobian by hand, We use the `jacobian()` function in the `autograd` library to auto-differentiate and calculate the Jacobian.

With only slight modification, we can generalize [our previous attempt](first_newton_attempt) to multi-dimensional problems

```{code-cell} ipython3
def newton(f, x_0, tol=1e-5, max_iter=10):
    x = x_0
    q = lambda x: x - np.linalg.solve(jacobian(f)(x), f(x))
    error = tol + 1
    n = 0
    while error > tol:
        n+=1
        if(n > max_iter):
            raise Exception('Max iteration reached without convergence')
        y = q(x)
        if(any(np.isnan(y))):
            raise Exception('Solution not found with NaN generated')
        error = np.linalg.norm(x - y)
        x = y
        print(f'iteration {n}, error = {error:.5f}')
    print('\n' + f'Result = {x} \n')
    return x
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
def e(p, A, b, c):
    return np.exp(- np.dot(A, p)) + c - b * np.sqrt(p)
```

We find the algorithm terminates in 4 steps

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%time
p = newton(lambda p: e(p, A, b, c), init_p)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
np.max(np.abs(e(p, A, b, c)))
```

The result is very accurate. 

With the larger overhead, the speed is not better than the optimized `scipy` function.


### A High-Dimensional Problem

Our next step is to investigate a large market with 3,000 goods.

A JAX version of this section using GPU accelerated linear algebra and
automatic differentiation is available [here](https://jax.quantecon.org/newtons_method.html#application)

The excess demand function is essentially the same, but now the matrix $A$ is $3000 \times 3000$ and the parameter vectors $b$ and $c$ are $3000 \times 1$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
dim = 3000
np.random.seed(123)

# Create a random matrix A and normalize the rows to sum to one
A = np.random.rand(dim, dim)
A = np.asarray(A)
s = np.sum(A, axis=0)
A = A / s

# Set up b and c
b = np.ones(dim)
c = np.ones(dim)
```

Here's our initial condition

```{code-cell} ipython3
init_p = np.ones(dim)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%time
p = newton(lambda p: e(p, A, b, c), init_p)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
np.max(np.abs(e(p, A, b, c)))
```

With the same tolerance, we compare the runtime and accuracy of Newton's method to SciPy's `root` function

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%time
solution = root(lambda p: e(p, A, b, c),
                init_p, 
                jac=lambda p: jacobian(e)(p, A, b, c), 
                method='hybr',
                tol=1e-5)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
p = solution.x
np.max(np.abs(e(p, A, b, c)))
```


## Exercises

```{exercise-start}
:label: newton_ex1
```

Consider a three-dimensional extension of the Solow fixed point problem with

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
            2 & 3 & 3 \\
            2 & 4 & 2 \\
            1 & 5 & 1 \\
        \end{pmatrix},
            \quad
s = 0.2, \quad α = 0.5, \quad δ = 0.8
$$

As before the law of motion is

```{math}
    k_{t+1} = g(k_t) \quad \text{where} \quad
    g(k) := sAk^\alpha + (1-\delta) k
```

However $k_t$ is now a $3 \times 1$ vector.

Solve for the fixed point using Newton's method with the following initial values:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    k1_{0} &= (1, 1, 1) \\
    k2_{0} &= (3, 5, 5) \\
    k3_{0} &= (50, 50, 50)
\end{aligned}
$$

````{hint} 
:class: dropdown

- The computation of the fixed point is equivalent to computing $k^*$ such that $f(k^*) - k^* = 0$.

- If you are unsure about your solution, you can start with the solved example:

```{math}
A = \begin{pmatrix}
            2 & 0 & 0 \\
            0 & 2 & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & 2 \\
        \end{pmatrix}
```

with $s = 0.3$, $α = 0.3$, and $δ = 0.4$ and starting value: 


```{math}
k_0 = (1, 1, 1)
```

The result should converge to the [analytical solution](solved_k).
````

```{exercise-end}
```


```{solution-start} newton_ex1
:class: dropdown
```

Let's first define the parameters for this problem

```{code-cell} ipython3
A = np.array([[2.0, 3.0, 3.0],
              [2.0, 4.0, 2.0],
              [1.0, 5.0, 1.0]])

s = 0.2
α = 0.5
δ = 0.8

initLs = [np.ones(3),
          np.array([3.0, 5.0, 5.0]),
          np.repeat(50.0, 3)]
```

Then define the multivariate version of the formula for the [law of motion of captial](motion_law)

```{code-cell} ipython3
def multivariate_solow(k, A=A, s=s, α=α, δ=δ):
    return (s * np.dot(A, k**α) + (1 - δ) * k)
```

Let's run through each starting value and see the output

```{code-cell} ipython3
attempt = 1
for init in initLs:
    print(f'Attempt {attempt}: Starting value is {init} \n')
    %time k = newton(lambda k: multivariate_solow(k) - k, \
                    init)
    print('-'*64)
    attempt += 1
```

We find that the results are invariant to the starting values given the well-defined property of this question.

But the number of iterations it takes to converge is dependent on the starting values.

Let substitute the output back to the formulate to check our last result

```{code-cell} ipython3
multivariate_solow(k) - k
```

Note the error is very small.

We can also test our results on the known solution

```{code-cell} ipython3
A = np.array([[2.0, 0.0, 0.0],
               [0.0, 2.0, 0.0],
               [0.0, 0.0, 2.0]])

s = 0.3
α = 0.3
δ = 0.4

init = np.repeat(1.0, 3)


%time k = newton(lambda k: multivariate_solow(k, A=A, s=s, α=α, δ=δ) - k, \
                 init)
```

The result is very close to the ground truth but still slightly different.

```{code-cell} python3
%time k = newton(lambda k: multivariate_solow(k, A=A, s=s, α=α, δ=δ) - k, \
                 init,\
                 tol=1e-7)
```

We can see it steps towards a more accurate solution.

```{solution-end}
```


```{exercise-start}
:label: newton_ex2
```

In this exercise, let's try different initial values and check how Newton's method responds to different starting points.

Let's define a three-good problem with the following default values:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
            0.2 & 0.1 & 0.7 \\
            0.3 & 0.2 & 0.5 \\
            0.1 & 0.8 & 0.1 \\
        \end{pmatrix},
            \qquad 
b = \begin{pmatrix}
            1 \\
            1 \\
            1
        \end{pmatrix}
    \qquad \text{and} \qquad
c = \begin{pmatrix}
            1 \\
            1 \\
            1
        \end{pmatrix}
$$

For this exercise, use the following extreme price vectors as initial values:

$$

\begin{aligned}
    p1_{0} &= (5, 5, 5) \\
    p2_{0} &= (1, 1, 1) \\
    p3_{0} &= (4.5, 0.1, 4)
\end{aligned}
$$

Set the tolerance to $0.0$ for more accurate output.

```{exercise-end}
```

```{solution-start} newton_ex2
:class: dropdown
```

Define parameters and initial values

```{code-cell} ipython3
A = np.array([
    [0.2, 0.1, 0.7],
    [0.3, 0.2, 0.5],
    [0.1, 0.8, 0.1]
])

b = np.array([1.0, 1.0, 1.0])
c = np.array([1.0, 1.0, 1.0])

initLs = [np.repeat(5.0, 3),
          np.ones(3),
          np.array([4.5, 0.1, 4.0])] 
```

Let’s run through each initial guess and check the output

```{code-cell} ipython3
---
tags: [raises-exception]
---

attempt = 1
for init in initLs:
    print(f'Attempt {attempt}: Starting value is {init} \n')
    %time p = newton(lambda p: e(p, A, b, c), \
                init, \
                tol=1e-15, \
                max_iter=15)
    print('-'*64)
    attempt += 1
```

We can find that Newton's method may fail for some starting values.

Sometimes it may take a few initial guesses to achieve convergence.

Substitute the result back to the formula to check our result

```{code-cell} ipython3
e(p, A, b, c)
```

We can see the result is very accurate.

```{solution-end}
```
