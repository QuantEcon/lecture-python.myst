# Statistical Divergence Measures

```{contents} Contents
:depth: 2
```

## Overview

A statistical divergence quantifies discrepancies between two distinct 
 probability distributions that can be   challenging to distinguish for the following reason:
 
  * every event that has positive probability  under one of the distributions also has positive probability under the other distribution

  * this means that  there is no "smoking gun" event whose occurrence  tells  a statistician that one of the probability distribution surely governs the data  

A statistical divergence is a **function** that maps two  probability distributions into a nonnegative real number.

Statistical divergence functions  play important roles in statistics, information theory, and what many people now call "machine learning". 

This lecture describes  three divergence measures:

* **Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence** 
* **Jensen–Shannon (JS) divergence** 
* **Chernoff entropy** 

These will appear in several quantecon lectures. 

Let's start by importing the necessary Python tools.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from numba import vectorize, jit
from math import gamma
from scipy.integrate import quad
from scipy.optimize import minimize_scalar
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display, Math
```





## Primer on Entropy, Cross-Entropy, KL Divergence

Before diving in, we'll introduce some useful concepts in a simple setting.

We'll temporarily assume that $f$ and $g$ are two probability mass functions for discrete random variables 
on state space $I = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$  that satisfy $f_i \geq 0, \sum_{i} f_i =1, g_i \geq 0, \sum_{i} g_i =1$.

We follow some  statisticians and information theorists who  define the **surprise** or **surprisal** 
associated with having  observed a single draw $x = i$ from distribution $f$  as

$$
\log\left(\frac{1}{f_i}\right)
$$

They then define the **information** that you can   anticipate  to gather from observing a single realization
as the expected surprisal 

$$
H(f) = \sum_i f_i \log\left(\frac{1}{f_i}\right).  
$$

Claude Shannon {cite}`shannon1948mathematical` called $H(f)$ the **entropy** of distribution $f$.


```{note}
By maximizing $H(f)$ with respect to $\{f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_n\}$ subject to $\sum_{f_i} = 1$, we can verify that the distribution
that maximizes entropy is the uniform distribution
$
f_i = \frac{1}{n} .
$
Entropy $H(f)$ for the uniform distribution evidently equals $- \log(n)$.  
```



Kullback and Leibler {cite}`kullback1951information` define the amount of information that a single draw of $x$ provides for distinguishing $f$ from $g$  as the log likelihood ratio 

$$
\log \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}
$$





The following two  concepts are widely used to compare two distributions $f$ and $g$. 



**Cross-Entropy:**

\begin{equation}
H(f,g) = -\sum_{i} f_i \log g_i
\end{equation}



**Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence:** 
\begin{equation}
D_{KL}(f \parallel g) = \sum_{i} f_i \log\left[\frac{f_i}{g_i}\right]
\end{equation}

These concepts are related by the following equality.

$$
{KL}(f \parallel g) = H(f,g) - H(f)
$$ (eq:KLcross)

To prove {eq}`eq:KLcross`, note that


\begin{align}
D_{KL}(f \parallel g) &= \sum_{i} f_i \log\left[\frac{f_i}{g_i}\right] \\
&= \sum_{i} f_i \left[\log f_i - \log g_i\right] \\
&= \sum_{i} f_i \log f_i - \sum_{i} f_i \log g_i \\
&= -H(f) + H(f,g) \\
&= H(f,g) - H(f)
\end{align}

Remember that $H(f)$ is the anticipated surprisal from drawing $x$ from $f$. 

Then the above equation tells us that  the KL divergence is an anticipated "excess surprise" that comes from anticipating that $x$ is drawn from $f$ when it is
actually drawn from $g$.  


## Two Beta Distributions: Running Example

We'll use Beta distributions extensively to illustrate concepts. 

The Beta distribution is particularly convenient as it's defined on $[0,1]$ and exhibits diverse shapes by appropriately choosing its  two parameters.

The density of a Beta distribution with parameters $a$ and $b$ is given by

$$
f(z; a, b) = \frac{\Gamma(a+b) z^{a-1} (1-z)^{b-1}}{\Gamma(a) \Gamma(b)}
\quad \text{where} \quad
\Gamma(p) := \int_{0}^{\infty} x^{p-1} e^{-x} dx
$$

Let's define parameters and density functions in Python

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Parameters in the two Beta distributions
F_a, F_b = 1, 1
G_a, G_b = 3, 1.2

@vectorize
def p(x, a, b):
    r = gamma(a + b) / (gamma(a) * gamma(b))
    return r * x** (a-1) * (1 - x) ** (b-1)

# The two density functions
f = jit(lambda x: p(x, F_a, F_b))
g = jit(lambda x: p(x, G_a, G_b))

# Plot the distributions
x_range = np.linspace(0.001, 0.999, 1000)
f_vals = [f(x) for x in x_range]
g_vals = [g(x) for x in x_range]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(x_range, f_vals, 'b-', linewidth=2, label=r'$f(x) \sim \text{Beta}(1,1)$')
plt.plot(x_range, g_vals, 'r-', linewidth=2, label=r'$g(x) \sim \text{Beta}(3,1.2)$')

# Fill overlap region
overlap = np.minimum(f_vals, g_vals)
plt.fill_between(x_range, 0, overlap, alpha=0.3, color='purple', label='overlap')

plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('density')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```



(rel_entropy)=
## Kullback–Leibler divergence

Our  first divergence function is the **Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence**. 

For probability densities (or pmfs) $f$ and $g$ it is defined by

$$
D_{KL}(f\|g) = KL(f, g) = \int f(x) \log \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \, dx.
$$

We can interpret $KL(f, g)$ as the expected excess log loss (expected excess surprisal) incurred when we use $g$ while the data are generated by $f$.   

It has several important properties:

- Non-negativity (Gibbs' inequality): $KL(f, g) \ge 0$ with equality if and only if $f=g$ almost everywhere.
- Asymmetry: $KL(f, g) \neq KL(g, f)$ in general (hence it is not a metric)
- Information decomposition:
  $KL(f, g) = H(f,g) - H(f)$, where $H(f,g)$ is the cross entropy and $H(f)$ is the Shannon entropy of $f$.
- Chain rule: For joint distributions $f(x, y)$ and $g(x, y)$, 
  $KL(f(x,y), g(x,y)) = KL(f(x), g(x)) + E_{f}\left[KL(f(y|x), g(y|x))\right]$

KL divergence plays a central role in statistical inference, including model selection and hypothesis testing.

{doc}`likelihood_ratio_process` describes a link between KL divergence and the expected log likelihood ratio, 
and the lecture {doc}`wald_friedman` connects it to the test performance of the sequential probability ratio test.

Let's compute the KL divergence between our example distributions $f$ and $g$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def compute_KL(f, g):
    """
    Compute KL divergence KL(f, g) via numerical integration
    """
    def integrand(w):
        fw = f(w)
        gw = g(w)
        return fw * np.log(fw / gw)
    val, _ = quad(integrand, 1e-5, 1-1e-5)
    return val

# Compute KL divergences between our example distributions
kl_fg = compute_KL(f, g)
kl_gf = compute_KL(g, f)

print(f"KL(f, g) = {kl_fg:.4f}")
print(f"KL(g, f) = {kl_gf:.4f}")
```

The asymmetry of KL divergence has important practical implications.

$KL(f, g)$ penalizes regions where $f > 0$ but $g$ is close to zero, reflecting the cost of using $g$ to model $f$ and vice versa.

## Jensen-Shannon divergence

Sometimes we want a symmetric measure of divergence that captures the difference between two distributions without favoring one over the other.

This often arises in applications like clustering, where we want to compare distributions without assuming one is the true model.

The **Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence** symmetrizes KL divergence by comparing both distributions to their mixture:

$$
JS(f,g) = \frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(f\|m) + \frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(g\|m), \quad m = \frac{1}{2}(f+g).
$$

where $m$ is a mixture distribution that averages $f$ and $g$

Let's also visualize the mixture distribution $m$:

```{code-cell} ipython3
def m(x):
    return 0.5 * (f(x) + g(x))

m_vals = [m(x) for x in x_range]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(x_range, f_vals, 'b-', linewidth=2, label=r'$f(x)$')
plt.plot(x_range, g_vals, 'r-', linewidth=2, label=r'$g(x)$')
plt.plot(x_range, m_vals, 'g--', linewidth=2, label=r'$m(x) = \frac{1}{2}(f(x) + g(x))$')

plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('density')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

The JS divergence has several useful properties:

- Symmetry: $JS(f,g)=JS(g,f)$.
- Boundedness: $0 \le JS(f,g) \le \log 2$.
- Its square root $\sqrt{JS}$ is a metric (Jensen–Shannon distance) on the space of probability distributions.
- JS divergence equals the mutual information between a binary random variable $Z \sim \text{Bernoulli}(1/2)$ indicating the source and a sample $X$ drawn from $f$ if $Z=0$ or from $g$ if $Z=1$.

The Jensen–Shannon divergence plays a key role in the optimization of certain 
generative models, as it is bounded, symmetric, and smoother than KL divergence, 
often providing more stable gradients for training.

Let's compute the JS divergence between our example distributions $f$ and $g$

```{code-cell} ipython3
def compute_JS(f, g):
    """Compute Jensen-Shannon divergence."""
    def m(w):
        return 0.5 * (f(w) + g(w))
    js_div = 0.5 * compute_KL(f, m) + 0.5 * compute_KL(g, m)
    return js_div

js_div = compute_JS(f, g)
print(f"Jensen-Shannon divergence JS(f,g) = {js_div:.4f}")
```

We can easily generalize with more than two distributions with generalized Jensen-Shannon divergence with weights $\alpha = (\alpha_i)_{i=1}^{n}$:

$$
JS_\alpha(f_1, \ldots, f_n) = 
H\left(\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i f_i\right) - \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i H(f_i)
$$

where:
- $\alpha_i \geq 0$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i = 1$, and
- $H(f) = -\int f(x) \log f(x) dx$ is the **Shannon entropy** of distribution $f$

## Chernoff entropy

Chernoff entropy originates from early applications of the [theory of large deviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_deviations_theory), which refines central limit approximations by providing exponential decay rates for rare events.


For densities $f$ and $g$ the Chernoff entropy is

$$
C(f,g) = - \log \min_{\phi \in (0,1)} \int f^{\phi}(x) g^{1-\phi}(x) \, dx.
$$

Remarks:

- The inner integral is the **Chernoff coefficient**. 
- At $\phi=1/2$ it becomes the **Bhattacharyya coefficient** $\int \sqrt{f g}$. 
- In binary hypothesis testing with $T$ iid observations, the optimal error probability decays as $e^{-C(f,g) T}$.

We will see and example of the third point in the lecture {doc}`likelihood_ratio_process`, 
where we study the Chernoff entropy in the context of model selection.

Let's compute the Chernoff entropy between our example distributions $f$ and $g$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def chernoff_integrand(ϕ, f, g):
    """Integral entering Chernoff entropy for a given ϕ."""
    def integrand(w):
        return f(w)**ϕ * g(w)**(1-ϕ)
    result, _ = quad(integrand, 1e-5, 1-1e-5)
    return result

def compute_chernoff_entropy(f, g):
    """Compute Chernoff entropy C(f,g)."""
    def objective(ϕ):
        return chernoff_integrand(ϕ, f, g)
    result = minimize_scalar(objective, bounds=(1e-5, 1-1e-5), method='bounded')
    min_value = result.fun
    ϕ_optimal = result.x
    chernoff_entropy = -np.log(min_value)
    return chernoff_entropy, ϕ_optimal

C_fg, ϕ_optimal = compute_chernoff_entropy(f, g)
print(f"Chernoff entropy C(f,g) = {C_fg:.4f}")
print(f"Optimal ϕ = {ϕ_optimal:.4f}")
```

## Comparing divergence measures

We now compare these measures across several pairs of Beta distributions

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

distribution_pairs = [
    # (f_params, g_params)
    ((1, 1), (0.1, 0.2)),
    ((1, 1), (0.3, 0.3)),
    ((1, 1), (0.3, 0.4)),
    ((1, 1), (0.5, 0.5)),
    ((1, 1), (0.7, 0.6)),
    ((1, 1), (0.9, 0.8)),
    ((1, 1), (1.1, 1.05)),
    ((1, 1), (1.2, 1.1)),
    ((1, 1), (1.5, 1.2)),
    ((1, 1), (2, 1.5)),
    ((1, 1), (2.5, 1.8)),
    ((1, 1), (3, 1.2)),
    ((1, 1), (4, 1)),
    ((1, 1), (5, 1))
]

# Create comparison table
results = []
for i, ((f_a, f_b), (g_a, g_b)) in enumerate(distribution_pairs):
    f = jit(lambda x, a=f_a, b=f_b: p(x, a, b))
    g = jit(lambda x, a=g_a, b=g_b: p(x, a, b))
    kl_fg = compute_KL(f, g)
    kl_gf = compute_KL(g, f)
    js_div = compute_JS(f, g)
    chernoff_ent, _ = compute_chernoff_entropy(f, g)
    results.append({
        'Pair (f, g)': f"\\text{{Beta}}({f_a},{f_b}), \\text{{Beta}}({g_a},{g_b})",
        'KL(f, g)': f"{kl_fg:.4f}",
        'KL(g, f)': f"{kl_gf:.4f}",
        'JS': f"{js_div:.4f}",
        'C': f"{chernoff_ent:.4f}"
    })

df = pd.DataFrame(results)
# Sort by JS divergence
df['JS_numeric'] = df['JS'].astype(float)
df = df.sort_values('JS_numeric').drop('JS_numeric', axis=1)

columns = ' & '.join([f'\\text{{{col}}}' for col in df.columns])
rows = ' \\\\\n'.join(
    [' & '.join([f'{val}' for val in row]) 
     for row in df.values])

latex_code = rf"""
\begin{{array}}{{lcccc}}
{columns} \\
\hline
{rows}
\end{{array}}
"""

display(Math(latex_code))
```

We can clearly see co-movement across the divergence measures as we vary the parameters of the Beta distributions.

Next we visualize relationships among KL, JS, and Chernoff entropy.

```{code-cell} ipython3
kl_fg_values = [float(result['KL(f, g)']) for result in results]
js_values = [float(result['JS']) for result in results]
chernoff_values = [float(result['C']) for result in results]

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5))

axes[0].scatter(kl_fg_values, js_values, alpha=0.7, s=60)
axes[0].set_xlabel('KL divergence KL(f, g)')
axes[0].set_ylabel('JS divergence')
axes[0].set_title('JS divergence vs KL divergence')

axes[1].scatter(js_values, chernoff_values, alpha=0.7, s=60)
axes[1].set_xlabel('JS divergence')
axes[1].set_ylabel('Chernoff entropy')
axes[1].set_title('Chernoff entropy vs JS divergence')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

We now generate plots illustrating how overlap visually diminishes as divergence measures increase.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def plot_dist_diff():
    """Plot overlap of selected Beta distribution pairs."""
    param_grid = [
        ((1, 1), (1, 1)),   
        ((1, 1), (1.5, 1.2)),
        ((1, 1), (2, 1.5)),  
        ((1, 1), (3, 1.2)),  
        ((1, 1), (5, 1)),
        ((1, 1), (0.3, 0.3))
    ]
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 2, figsize=(15, 12))
    divergence_data = []
    for i, ((f_a, f_b), (g_a, g_b)) in enumerate(param_grid):
        row, col = divmod(i, 2)
        f = jit(lambda x, a=f_a, b=f_b: p(x, a, b))
        g = jit(lambda x, a=g_a, b=g_b: p(x, a, b))
        kl_fg = compute_KL(f, g)
        js_div = compute_JS(f, g)
        chernoff_ent, _ = compute_chernoff_entropy(f, g)
        divergence_data.append({
            'f_params': (f_a, f_b),
            'g_params': (g_a, g_b),
            'kl_fg': kl_fg,
            'js_div': js_div,
            'chernoff': chernoff_ent
        })
        x_range = np.linspace(0, 1, 200)
        f_vals = [f(x) for x in x_range]
        g_vals = [g(x) for x in x_range]
        axes[row, col].plot(x_range, f_vals, 'b-', 
                        linewidth=2, label=f'f ~ Beta({f_a},{f_b})')
        axes[row, col].plot(x_range, g_vals, 'r-', 
                        linewidth=2, label=f'g ~ Beta({g_a},{g_b})')
        overlap = np.minimum(f_vals, g_vals)
        axes[row, col].fill_between(x_range, 0, 
                        overlap, alpha=0.3, color='purple', label='overlap')
        axes[row, col].set_title(
            f'KL(f,g)={kl_fg:.3f}, JS={js_div:.3f}, C={chernoff_ent:.3f}', 
            fontsize=12)
        axes[row, col].legend(fontsize=12)
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
    return divergence_data

divergence_data = plot_dist_diff()
```



## KL Divergence and Maximum-Likelihood Estimation


Given a sample of $n$ observations $X = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$, the **empirical distribution** is 

$$p_e(x) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \delta(x - x_i)$$

where $\delta(x - x_i)$ is the Dirac delta function centered at $x_i$:

$$
\delta(x - x_i) = \begin{cases}
+\infty & \text{if } x = x_i \\
0 & \text{if } x \neq x_i
\end{cases}
$$

- **Discrete probability measure**: Assigns probability $\frac{1}{n}$ to each observed data point
- **Empirical expectation**: $\langle X \rangle_{p_e} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i = \bar{\mu}$
- **Support**: Only on the observed data points $\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$


The KL divergence from the empirical distribution $p_e$ to a parametric model $p_\theta(x)$ is:

$$\text{KL}(p_e \parallel p_\theta) = \int p_e(x) \log \frac{p_e(x)}{p_\theta(x)} dx$$

Using the mathematics of the Dirac delta function, it follows that 

$$\text{KL}(p_e \parallel p_\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{n} \log \frac{\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)}{p_\theta(x_i)}$$

$$= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \log \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \log p_\theta(x_i)$$

$$= -\log {n} - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \log p_\theta(x_i)$$

Since the log-likelihood function for parameter $\theta$ is:

$$
\ell(\theta; X) = \sum_{i=1}^n \log p_\theta(x_i) ,
$$

it follows that maximum likelihood chooses parameters to minimize

$$ KL(p_e \parallel p_\theta) $$


Thus, MLE is equivalent to minimizing the KL divergence from the empirical distribution to statistical  model $p_\theta$.
