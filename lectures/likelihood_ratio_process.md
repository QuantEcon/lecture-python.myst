In addition to whatâ€™s in Anaconda, this lecture will need the following libraries:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-output]
!pip install --upgrade quantecon
```

## Overview

This lecture describes likelihood ratio processes and some of their uses.

We'll study the same setting that is also used in {doc}`this lecture on exchangeability <exchangeable>`.

Among the things that we'll learn are

* How a likelihood ratio process is a key ingredient in frequentist hypothesis testing
* How a **receiver operator characteristic curve** summarizes information about a false alarm probability and power in frequentist hypothesis testing
* How a statistician can combine frequentist probabilities of type I and type II errors to form posterior probabilities of mistakes in a model selection or in an individual-classification problem
* How to use a Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify the difference between two probability distributions with the same support 
* How during World War II the United States Navy devised a decision rule for doing quality control on lots of ammunition, a topic that sets the stage for {doc}`this lecture <wald_friedman>`
* A peculiar property of likelihood ratio processes

## Likelihood Ratio Process

A nonnegative random variable $W$ has one of two probability density functions, either
$f$ or $g$.

Before the beginning of time, nature once and for all decides whether she will draw a sequence of IID draws from either
$f$ or $g$.

We will sometimes let $q$ be the density that nature chose once and for all, so
that $q$ is either $f$ or $g$, permanently.

Nature knows which density it permanently draws from, but we the observers do not.

We know both $f$ and $g$ but we don't know which density nature
chose.

But we want to know.

To do that, we use observations.

We observe a sequence $\{w_t\}_{t=1}^T$ of $T$ IID draws that we know came from either $f$ or $g$.

We want to use these observations to infer whether nature chose $f$ or $g$.

A **likelihood ratio process** is a useful tool for this task.

To begin, we define a key component of a likelihood ratio process, namely, the time $t$ likelihood ratio as the random variable

$$
\ell (w_t)=\frac{f\left(w_t\right)}{g\left(w_t\right)},\quad t\geq1.
$$

We assume that $f$ and $g$ both put positive probabilities on the
same intervals of possible realizations of the random variable $W$.

That means that under the $g$ density, $\ell (w_t)=
\frac{f\left(w_{t}\right)}{g\left(w_{t}\right)}$
is a nonnegative random variable with mean $1$.

A **likelihood ratio process** for sequence
$\left\{ w_{t}\right\} _{t=1}^{\infty}$ is defined as

$$
L\left(w^{t}\right)=\prod_{i=1}^{t} \ell (w_i),
$$

where $w^t=\{ w_1,\dots,w_t\}$ is a history of
observations up to and including time $t$.

Sometimes for shorthand we'll write $L_t = L(w^t)$.

Notice that the likelihood process satisfies the *recursion* 

$$
L(w^t) = \ell (w_t) L (w^{t-1}) .
$$

The likelihood ratio and its logarithm are key tools for making
inferences using a classic frequentist approach due to Neyman and
Pearson {cite}`Neyman_Pearson`.

To help us appreciate how things work, the following Python code evaluates $f$ and $g$ as two different
Beta distributions, then computes and simulates an associated likelihood
ratio process by generating a sequence $w^t$ from one of the two
probability distributions, for example, a sequence of IID draws from $g$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Parameters for the two Beta distributions
F_a, F_b = 1, 1
G_a, G_b = 3, 1.2

@vectorize
def p(x, a, b):
    """Beta distribution density function."""
    r = gamma(a + b) / (gamma(a) * gamma(b))
    return r * x** (a-1) * (1 - x) ** (b-1)

f = jit(lambda x: p(x, F_a, F_b))
g = jit(lambda x: p(x, G_a, G_b))

    """Create a beta density function with specified parameters."""
    return jit(lambda x: p(x, a, b))

    plt.ylabel('$L(w^t)$')
    plt.show()
```

## Nature permanently draws from density g

We first simulate the likelihood ratio process when nature permanently
draws from $g$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Simulate when nature draws from g
l_arr_g, l_seq_g = simulate_sequences('g', f, g, (F_a, F_b), (G_a, G_b))
plot_likelihood_paths(l_seq_g, 
                     title="$L(w^{t})$ paths when nature draws from g",
                     ylim=[0, 3])
```

Evidently, as sample length $T$ grows, most probability mass
shifts toward zero

To see this more clearly, we plot over time the fraction of
paths $L\left(w^{t}\right)$ that fall in the interval
$\left[0, 0.01\right]$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
N, T = l_arr_g.shape
plt.plot(range(T), np.sum(l_seq_g <= 0.01, axis=0) / N)
plt.show()
```

Despite the evident convergence of most probability mass to a
very small interval near $0$, the unconditional mean of
$L\left(w^t\right)$ under probability density $g$ is
identically $1$ for all $t$.

To verify this assertion, first notice that as mentioned earlier the unconditional mean
$E\left[\ell \left(w_{t}\right)\bigm|q=g\right]$ is $1$ for
all $t$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
E\left[\ell \left(w_{t}\right)\bigm|q=g\right]  &=\int\frac{f\left(w_{t}\right)}{g\left(w_{t}\right)}g\left(w_{t}\right)dw_{t} \\
    &=\int f\left(w_{t}\right)dw_{t} \\
    &=1,
\end{aligned}
$$

which immediately implies

$$
\begin{aligned}
E\left[L\left(w^{1}\right)\bigm|q=g\right]  &=E\left[\ell \left(w_{1}\right)\bigm|q=g\right]\\
    &=1.\\
\end{aligned}
$$

Because $L(w^t) = \ell(w_t) L(w^{t-1})$ and
$\{w_t\}_{t=1}^t$ is an IID sequence, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
E\left[L\left(w^{t}\right)\bigm|q=g\right]  &=E\left[L\left(w^{t-1}\right)\ell \left(w_{t}\right)\bigm|q=g\right] \\
         &=E\left[L\left(w^{t-1}\right)E\left[\ell \left(w_{t}\right)\bigm|q=g,w^{t-1}\right]\bigm|q=g\right] \\
     &=E\left[L\left(w^{t-1}\right)E\left[\ell \left(w_{t}\right)\bigm|q=g\right]\bigm|q=g\right] \\
    &=E\left[L\left(w^{t-1}\right)\bigm|q=g\right] \\
\end{aligned}
$$

for any $t \geq 1$.

Mathematical induction implies
$E\left[L\left(w^{t}\right)\bigm|q=g\right]=1$ for all
$t \geq 1$.

## Peculiar property

How can $E\left[L\left(w^{t}\right)\bigm|q=g\right]=1$ possibly be true when most probability mass of the likelihood
ratio process is piling up near $0$ as
$t \rightarrow + \infty$?

The answer is that as $t \rightarrow + \infty$, the
distribution of $L_t$ becomes more and more fat-tailed:
enough mass shifts to larger and larger values of $L_t$ to make
the mean of $L_t$ continue to be one despite most of the probability mass piling up
near $0$.

To illustrate this peculiar property, we simulate many paths and
calculate the unconditional mean of $L\left(w^t\right)$ by
averaging across these many paths at each $t$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
l_arr_g, l_seq_g = simulate_sequences('g', 
                f, g, (F_a, F_b), (G_a, G_b), N=50000)
```

It would be useful to use simulations to verify that unconditional means
$E\left[L\left(w^{t}\right)\right]$ equal unity by averaging across sample
paths.

But it would be too computer-time-consuming for us to do that here simply by applying a standard Monte Carlo simulation approach.

The reason is that the distribution of $L\left(w^{t}\right)$ is extremely skewed for large values of $t$.

Because the probability density in the right tail is close to $0$, it just takes too much computer time to sample enough points from the right tail.

We explain the problem in more detail in {doc}`this lecture <imp_sample>`.

There we describe an alternative way to compute the mean of a likelihood ratio by computing the mean of a _different_ random variable by sampling from a _different_ probability distribution.


## Nature permanently draws from density f

Now suppose that before time $0$ nature permanently decided to draw repeatedly from density $f$.

While the mean of the likelihood ratio $\ell \left(w_{t}\right)$ under density
$g$ is $1$, its mean under the density $f$ exceeds one.

To see this, we compute

$$
\begin{aligned}
E\left[\ell \left(w_{t}\right)\bigm|q=f\right]  &=\int\frac{f\left(w_{t}\right)}{g\left(w_{t}\right)}f\left(w_{t}\right)dw_{t} \\
     &=\int\frac{f\left(w_{t}\right)}{g\left(w_{t}\right)}\frac{f\left(w_{t}\right)}{g\left(w_{t}\right)}g\left(w_{t}\right)dw_{t} \\
     &=\int \ell \left(w_{t}\right)^{2}g\left(w_{t}\right)dw_{t} \\
     &=E\left[\ell \left(w_{t}\right)^{2}\mid q=g\right] \\
     &=E\left[\ell \left(w_{t}\right)\mid q=g\right]^{2}+Var\left(\ell \left(w_{t}\right)\mid q=g\right) \\
     &>E\left[\ell \left(w_{t}\right)\mid q=g\right]^{2} = 1 \\
       \end{aligned}
$$

This in turn implies that the unconditional mean of the likelihood ratio process $L(w^t)$
diverges toward $+ \infty$.

Simulations below confirm this conclusion.

Please note the scale of the $y$ axis.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Simulate when nature draws from f
l_arr_f, l_seq_f = simulate_sequences('f', f, g, 
                        (F_a, F_b), (G_a, G_b), N=50000)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
N, T = l_arr_f.shape
plt.plot(range(T), np.mean(l_seq_f, axis=0))
plt.show()
```

We also plot the probability that $L\left(w^t\right)$ falls into
the interval $[10000, \infty)$ as a function of time and watch how
fast probability mass diverges to $+\infty$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
plt.plot(range(T), np.sum(l_seq_f > 10000, axis=0) / N)
plt.show()
```

## Likelihood ratio test

We now describe how to employ the machinery
of Neyman and Pearson {cite}`Neyman_Pearson` to test the hypothesis that history $w^t$ is generated by repeated
IID draws from density $f$.

Denote $q$ as the data generating process, so that
$q=f \text{ or } g$.

Upon observing a sample $\{W_i\}_{i=1}^t$, we want to decide
whether nature is drawing from $g$ or from $f$ by performing a (frequentist)
hypothesis test.

We specify

- Null hypothesis $H_0$: $q=f$,
- Alternative hypothesis $H_1$: $q=g$.

Neyman and Pearson proved that the best way to test this hypothesis is to use a **likelihood ratio test** that takes the
form:

- accept $H_0$ if $L(W^t) > c$,
- reject $H_0$ if $L(W^t) < c$,


where $c$ is a given discrimination threshold.

Setting $c =1$ is a common choice.

We'll discuss consequences of other choices of $c$ below.  

This test is *best* in the sense that it is **uniformly most powerful**.

To understand what this means, we have to define probabilities of two important events that
allow us to characterize a test associated with a given
threshold $c$.

The two probabilities are:


- Probability of a Type I error in which we reject $H_0$ when it is true: 
  
  $$
  \alpha \equiv  \Pr\left\{ L\left(w^{t}\right)<c\mid q=f\right\}
  $$

- Probability of a Type II error in which we accept $H_0$ when it is false:

  $$
  \beta \equiv \Pr\left\{ L\left(w^{t}\right)>c\mid q=g\right\}
  $$

These two probabilities underlie the following two concepts: 


- Probability of false alarm (= significance level = probability of
  Type I error):

  $$
  \alpha \equiv  \Pr\left\{ L\left(w^{t}\right)<c\mid q=f\right\}
  $$

- Probability of detection (= power = 1 minus probability
  of Type II error):

  $$
  1-\beta \equiv \Pr\left\{ L\left(w^{t}\right)<c\mid q=g\right\}
  $$



The [Neyman-Pearson
Lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neymanâ€“Pearson_lemma)
states that among all possible tests, a likelihood ratio test
maximizes the probability of detection for a given probability of false
alarm.

Another way to say the same thing is that among all possible tests, a likelihood ratio test
maximizes **power** for a given **significance level**.

We want a small probability of
false alarm and a large probability of detection.

With sample size $t$ fixed, we can change our two probabilities by
adjusting $c$.

A troublesome "that's life" fact is that these two probabilities move in the same direction as we vary the critical value
$c$.

Without specifying quantitative losses from making Type I and Type II errors, there is little that we can say
about how we *should* trade off probabilities of the two types of mistakes.

We do know that increasing sample size $t$ improves
statistical inference.

Below we plot some informative figures that illustrate this.

We also present a classical frequentist method for choosing a sample
size $t$.

Let's start with a case in which we fix the threshold $c$ at
$1$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
c = 1
```

Below we plot empirical distributions of logarithms of the cumulative
likelihood ratios simulated above, which are generated by either
$f$ or $g$.

Taking logarithms has no effect on calculating the probabilities because
the log is a monotonic transformation.

As $t$ increases, the probabilities of making Type I and Type II
errors both decrease, which is good.

This is because most of the probability mass of log$(L(w^t))$
moves toward $-\infty$ when $g$ is the data generating
process, while log$(L(w^t))$ goes to
$\infty$ when data are generated by $f$.

That disparate behavior of log$(L(w^t))$ under $f$ and $g$
is what makes it possible eventually to distinguish
$q=f$ from $q=g$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def plot_log_histograms(l_seq_f, l_seq_g, c=1, time_points=[1, 7, 14, 21]):
    """Plot log likelihood ratio histograms."""
    fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(12, 8))
    
    for i, t in enumerate(time_points):
        nr, nc = i // 2, i % 2
        
        axs[nr, nc].axvline(np.log(c), color="k", ls="--")
        
        hist_f, x_f = np.histogram(np.log(l_seq_f[:, t]), 200, density=True)
        hist_g, x_g = np.histogram(np.log(l_seq_g[:, t]), 200, density=True)
        
        axs[nr, nc].plot(x_f[1:], hist_f, label="dist under f")
        axs[nr, nc].plot(x_g[1:], hist_g, label="dist under g")
        
        # Fill error regions
        for j, (x, hist, label) in enumerate(
            zip([x_f, x_g], [hist_f, hist_g], 
            ["Type I error", "Type II error"])):
            ind = x[1:] <= np.log(c) if j == 0 else x[1:] > np.log(c)
            axs[nr, nc].fill_between(x[1:][ind], hist[ind], 
                                    alpha=0.5, label=label)
        
        axs[nr, nc].legend()
        axs[nr, nc].set_title(f"t={t}")
    
    plt.show()

plot_log_histograms(l_seq_f, l_seq_g, c=c)
```

In the above graphs, 
  * the blue areas are related to but not equal to probabilities $\alpha $ of a type I error because 
they are integrals of $\log L_t$, not integrals of $L_t$, over rejection region $L_t < 1$  
* the orange areas are related to but not equal to probabilities $\beta $ of a type II error because 
they are integrals of $\log L_t$, not integrals of $L_t$, over acceptance region $L_t > 1$


When we hold $c$ fixed at $c=1$, the following graph shows that 
  * the probability of detection monotonically increases with increases in
$t$ 
  * the probability of a false alarm monotonically decreases with increases in $t$.

```{code-cell} ipython3

    return {
        'alpha': PFA,
        'beta': beta,

error_probs = compute_error_probabilities(l_seq_f, l_seq_g, c=c)
N, T = l_seq_f.shape
plot_error_probabilities(error_probs, T, c)
```

For a given sample size $t$, the threshold $c$ uniquely pins down probabilities
of both types of error.

If for a fixed $t$ we now free up and move $c$, we will sweep out the probability
of detection as a function of the probability of false alarm.

This produces a [receiver operating characteristic
curve (ROC curve)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic).

Below, we plot receiver operating characteristic curves for different
sample sizes $t$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def plot_roc_curves(l_seq_f, l_seq_g, t_values=[1, 5, 9, 13], N=None):
    """Plot ROC curves for different sample sizes."""
    if N is None:
        N = l_seq_f.shape[0]
    
    PFA = np.arange(0, 100, 1)
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    for t in t_values:
        percentile = np.percentile(l_seq_f[:, t], PFA)
        PD = [np.sum(l_seq_g[:, t] < p) / N for p in percentile]
        plt.plot(PFA / 100, PD, label=f"t={t}")
    
    plt.scatter(0, 1, label="perfect detection")
    plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color='k', ls='--', label="random detection")
    
    plt.arrow(0.5, 0.5, -0.15, 0.15, head_width=0.03)
    plt.text(0.35, 0.7, "better")
    plt.xlabel("Probability of false alarm")
    plt.ylabel("Probability of detection")
    plt.legend()
    plt.title("ROC Curve")
    plt.show()


plot_roc_curves(l_seq_f, l_seq_g, t_values=range(1, 15, 4), N=N)
```

Notice that as $t$ increases, we are assured a larger probability
of detection and a smaller probability of false alarm associated with
a given discrimination threshold $c$.

For a given sample size $t$, both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ change as we vary $c$.

As we increase $c$

* $\alpha \equiv  \Pr\left\{ L\left(w^{t}\right)<c\mid q=f\right\}$ increases  
* $\beta \equiv \Pr\left\{ L\left(w^{t}\right)>c\mid q=g\right\}$ decreases

As $t \rightarrow + \infty$, we approach the perfect detection
curve that is indicated by a right angle hinging on the blue dot.

For a given sample size $t$, the discrimination threshold $c$ determines a point on the receiver operating
characteristic curve.

It is up to the test designer to trade off probabilities of
making the two types of errors.

But we know how to choose the smallest sample size to achieve given targets for
the probabilities.

Typically, frequentists aim for a high probability of detection that
respects an upper bound on the probability of false alarm.

Below we show an example in which we fix the probability of false alarm at
$0.05$.

The required sample size for making a decision is then determined by a
target probability of detection, for example, $0.9$, as depicted in the following graph.

```{code-cell} ipython3
PFA = 0.05
PD = np.empty(T)

for t in range(T):

    c = np.percentile(l_seq_f[:, t], PFA * 100)
    PD[t] = np.sum(l_seq_g[:, t] < c) / N

plt.plot(range(T), PD)
plt.axhline(0.9, color="k", ls="--")

plt.xlabel("t")
plt.ylabel("Probability of detection")
plt.title(f"Probability of false alarm={PFA}")
plt.show()
```

The United States Navy evidently used a procedure like this to select a sample size $t$ for doing quality
control tests during World War II.

A Navy Captain who had been ordered to perform tests of this kind had doubts about it that he
presented to Milton Friedman, as we describe in {doc}`this lecture <wald_friedman>`.

(llr_h)=
### A third distribution $h$

Now let's consider a case in which neither $g$ nor $f$
generates the data.

Instead, a third distribution $h$ does.

Let's study how accumulated likelihood ratios $L$ behave
when $h$ governs the data.

A key tool here is called **Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence** we studied in {doc}`divergence_measures`.

In our application, we want to measure how much $f$ or $g$
diverges from $h$

Two Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergences pertinent for us are $K_f$
and $K_g$ defined as

$$
\begin{aligned}
K_{f} = D_{KL}\bigl(h\|f\bigr) = KL(h, f)
          &= E_{h}\left[\log\frac{h(w)}{f(w)}\right] \\
          &= \int \log\left(\frac{h(w)}{f(w)}\right)h(w)dw .
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
K_{g} = D_{KL}\bigl(h\|g\bigr) = KL(h, g)
          &= E_{h}\left[\log\frac{h(w)}{g(w)}\right] \\
          &= \int \log\left(\frac{h(w)}{g(w)}\right)h(w)dw .
\end{aligned}
$$

Let's compute the Kullbackâ€“Leibler discrepancies using the same code in {doc}`divergence_measures`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def compute_KL(f, g):
    """
    Compute KL divergence KL(f, g)
    """
    integrand = lambda w: f(w) * np.log(f(w) / g(w))
    val, _ = quad(integrand, 1e-5, 1-1e-5)
    return val

def compute_KL_h(h, f, g):
    """
    Compute KL divergences with respect to reference distribution h
    """
    Kf = compute_KL(h, f)
    Kg = compute_KL(h, g)
    return Kf, Kg
```

(KL_link)=
### A helpful formula

There is a mathematical relationship between likelihood ratios and KL divergence. 

When data is generated by distribution $h$, the expected log likelihood ratio is:

$$
\frac{1}{t} E_{h}\!\bigl[\log L_t\bigr] = K_g - K_f
$$ (eq:kl_likelihood_link)

where $L_t=\prod_{j=1}^{t}\frac{f(w_j)}{g(w_j)}$ is the likelihood ratio process.

Equation {eq}`eq:kl_likelihood_link` tells us that:
- When $K_g < K_f$ (i.e., $g$ is closer to $h$ than $f$ is), the expected log likelihood ratio is negative, so $L\left(w^t\right) \rightarrow 0$.
- When $K_g > K_f$ (i.e., $f$ is closer to $h$ than $g$ is), the expected log likelihood ratio is positive, so $L\left(w^t\right) \rightarrow + \infty$.

Let's verify this using simulation.

In the simulation, we generate multiple paths using Beta distributions $f$, $g$, and $h$, and compute the paths of $\log(L(w^t))$.

First, we write a function to compute the likelihood ratio process

```{code-cell} ipython3
def compute_likelihood_ratios(sequences, f, g):
    """Compute likelihood ratios and cumulative products."""
    l_ratios = f(sequences) / g(sequences)
    L_cumulative = np.cumprod(l_ratios, axis=1)
    return l_ratios, L_cumulative
```

We consider three cases: (1) $h$ is closer to $f$, (2) $f$ and $g$ are approximately equidistant from $h$, and (3) $h$ is closer to $g$.

Note that

- In the first figure, $\log L(w^t)$ diverges to $\infty$ because $K_g > K_f$.
- In the second figure, we still have $K_g > K_f$, but the difference is smaller, so $L(w^t)$ diverges to infinity at a slower pace.
- In the last figure, $\log L(w^t)$ diverges to $-\infty$ because $K_g < K_f$.
- The black dotted line, $t \left(D_{KL}(h\|g) - D_{KL}(h\|f)\right)$, closely fits the paths verifying {eq}`eq:kl_likelihood_link`.

These observations align with the theory.

In {doc}`likelihood_ratio_process_2`, we will see an application of these ideas.

## Hypothesis testing and classification 

This section discusses another application of likelihood ratio processes.

We describe how a statistician can combine frequentist probabilities of type I and type II errors in order to 

* compute an anticipated frequency of  selecting a wrong model based on a sample length $T$
* compute an anticipated error  rate in a classification problem 

We consider a situation in which  nature generates data by mixing known densities $f$ and $g$ with known mixing
parameter $\pi_{-1} \in (0,1)$ so that the random variable $w$ is drawn from the density

$$
h (w) = \pi_{-1} f(w) + (1-\pi_{-1}) g(w) 
$$

We assume that the statistician knows the densities $f$ and $g$ and also the mixing parameter $\pi_{-1}$.

Below, we'll  set $\pi_{-1} = .5$, although much of the analysis would follow through with other settings of $\pi_{-1} \in (0,1)$.  

We assume that $f$ and $g$ both put positive probabilities on the same intervals of possible realizations of the random variable $W$.

  

In the simulations below, we specify that $f$ is a $\text{Beta}(1, 1)$ distribution and that $g$ is $\text{Beta}(3, 1.2)$ distribution.

We consider two alternative timing protocols. 

 * Timing protocol 1 is for   the model selection problem
 * Timing protocol 2 is for the individual classification problem 

**Timing Protocol 1:**  Nature flips a coin only **once** at time $t=-1$ and with probability $\pi_{-1}$  generates a sequence  $\{w_t\}_{t=1}^T$
of  IID  draws from  $f$  and with probability $1-\pi_{-1}$ generates a sequence  $\{w_t\}_{t=1}^T$
of  IID  draws from  $g$.

**Timing Protocol 2.** Nature flips a coin **often**.  At each time $t \geq 0$, nature flips a coin and with probability $\pi_{-1}$ draws $w_t$ from $f$ and with probability $1-\pi_{-1}$ draws $w_t$ from $g$.

Here is  Python code that we'll use to implement timing protocol 1 and 2

```{code-cell} ipython3
def protocol_1(Ï€_minus_1, T, N=1000, F_params=(1, 1), G_params=(3, 1.2)):
    """
    Simulate Protocol 1: Nature decides once at t=-1 which model to use.
    """
    F_a, F_b = F_params
    G_a, G_b = G_params
    
    # Single coin flip for the true model
    true_models_F = np.random.rand(N) < Ï€_minus_1
    sequences = np.empty((N, T))
    
    n_f = np.sum(true_models_F)
    n_g = N - n_f
    
    if n_f > 0:
        sequences[true_models_F, :] = np.random.beta(F_a, F_b, (n_f, T))
    if n_g > 0:
        sequences[~true_models_F, :] = np.random.beta(G_a, G_b, (n_g, T))
    
    return sequences, true_models_F

def protocol_2(Ï€_minus_1, T, N=1000, F_params=(1, 1), G_params=(3, 1.2)):
    """
    Simulate Protocol 2: Nature decides at each time step which model to use.
    """
    F_a, F_b = F_params
    G_a, G_b = G_params
    
    # Coin flips for each time step
    true_models_F = np.random.rand(N, T) < Ï€_minus_1
    sequences = np.empty((N, T))
    
    n_f = np.sum(true_models_F)
    n_g = N * T - n_f
    
    if n_f > 0:
        sequences[true_models_F] = np.random.beta(F_a, F_b, n_f)
    if n_g > 0:
        sequences[~true_models_F] = np.random.beta(G_a, G_b, n_g)
    
    return sequences, true_models_F
```

**Remark:** Under timing protocol 2, the $\{w_t\}_{t=1}^T$ is a sequence of IID draws from $h(w)$. Under timing protocol 1, the $\{w_t\}_{t=1}^T$ is 
not IID. It is **conditionally IID** -- meaning that with probability $\pi_{-1}$ it is a sequence of IID draws from $f(w)$ and with probability $1-\pi_{-1}$ it is a sequence of IID draws from $g(w)$. For more about this, see {doc}`this lecture about exchangeability <exchangeable>`.

We again deploy a **likelihood ratio process** with time $t$ component being the likelihood ratio  

$$
\ell (w_t)=\frac{f\left(w_t\right)}{g\left(w_t\right)},\quad t\geq1.
$$

The **likelihood ratio process** for sequence $\left\{ w_{t}\right\} _{t=1}^{\infty}$ is 

$$
L\left(w^{t}\right)=\prod_{i=1}^{t} \ell (w_i),
$$

For shorthand we'll write $L_t =  L(w^t)$.

### Model selection mistake probability 

We first study  a problem that assumes  timing protocol 1.  

Consider a decision maker who wants to know whether model $f$ or model $g$ governs a data set of length $T$ observations.

The decision makers has observed a sequence $\{w_t\}_{t=1}^T$.

On the basis of that observed  sequence, a likelihood ratio test selects model $f$ when
 $L_T \geq 1 $ and model $g$ when  $L_T < 1$.  
 
When model $f$ generates the data, the probability that the likelihood ratio test selects the wrong model is 

$$ 
p_f = {\rm Prob}\left(L_T < 1\Big| f\right) = \alpha_T .
$$

When model $g$ generates the data, the probability that the likelihood ratio test selects the wrong model is 

$$ 
p_g = {\rm Prob}\left(L_T \geq 1 \Big|g \right) = \beta_T.
$$

We can construct a probability that the likelihood ratio selects the wrong model by assigning a Bayesian prior probability of $\pi_{-1} = .5$ that nature selects model $f$ then  averaging $p_f$ and $p_g$ to form the Bayesian posterior probability of a detection error equal to

$$ 
p(\textrm{wrong decision}) = {1 \over 2} (\alpha_T + \beta_T) .
$$ (eq:detectionerrorprob)

Now let's simulate timing protocol 1 and compute the error probabilities

```{code-cell} ipython3

def compute_protocol_1_errors(Ï€_minus_1, T_max, N_simulations, f_func, g_func, 
                              F_params=(1, 1), G_params=(3, 1.2)):
    """
    Compute error probabilities for Protocol 1.
    """
    sequences, true_models = protocol_1(
        Ï€_minus_1, T_max, N_simulations, F_params, G_params)
    l_ratios, L_cumulative = compute_likelihood_ratios(sequences, 
                                    f_func, g_func)
    
    T_range = np.arange(1, T_max + 1)
    
    mask_f = true_models
    mask_g = ~true_models
    
    L_f = L_cumulative[mask_f, :]
    L_g = L_cumulative[mask_g, :]
    
    Î±_T = np.mean(L_f < 1, axis=0)
    Î²_T = np.mean(L_g >= 1, axis=0)
    error_prob = 0.5 * (Î±_T + Î²_T)
    
    return {
        'T_range': T_range,
        'alpha': Î±_T,
        'beta': Î²_T, 
        'error_prob': error_prob,
        'L_cumulative': L_cumulative,
        'true_models': true_models
    }
```

The following code visualizes the error probabilities for timing protocol 1

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

def analyze_protocol_1(Ï€_minus_1, T_max, N_simulations, f_func, g_func, 
                      F_params=(1, 1), G_params=(3, 1.2)):
    """Analyze Protocol 1"""
    result = compute_protocol_1_errors(Ï€_minus_1, T_max, N_simulations, 
                                      f_func, g_func, F_params, G_params)
    
    # Plot results
    fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5))
    
    ax1.plot(result['T_range'], result['alpha'], 'b-', 
             label=r'$\alpha_T$', linewidth=2)
    ax1.plot(result['T_range'], result['beta'], 'r-', 
             label=r'$\beta_T$', linewidth=2)
    ax1.set_xlabel('$T$')
    ax1.set_ylabel('error probability')
    ax1.legend()
    
    ax2.plot(result['T_range'], result['error_prob'], 'g-', 
             label=r'$\frac{1}{2}(\alpha_T+\beta_T)$', linewidth=2)
    ax2.set_xlabel('$T$')
    ax2.set_ylabel('error probability')
    ax2.legend()
    
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
    
    # Print summary
    print(f"At T={T_max}:")
    print(f"Î±_{T_max} = {result['alpha'][-1]:.4f}")
    print(f"Î²_{T_max} = {result['beta'][-1]:.4f}")
    print(f"Model selection error probability = {result['error_prob'][-1]:.4f}")
    
    return result

# Analyze Protocol 1
Ï€_minus_1 = 0.5
T_max = 30
N_simulations = 10_000

result_p1 = analyze_protocol_1(Ï€_minus_1, T_max, N_simulations, 
                                f, g, (F_a, F_b), (G_a, G_b))
```

Notice how the model selection  error probability approaches zero as $T$ grows.  

### Classification

We now consider a problem that assumes timing protocol 2.

A decision maker wants to classify components of an observed sequence $\{w_t\}_{t=1}^T$ as having been drawn from either $f$ or $g$.

The decision maker uses the following classification rule:

$$
\begin{aligned}
w_t  & \ {\rm is \ from \ }  f  \ {\rm if \ } l_t > 1 \\
w_t  & \ {\rm is \ from \ } g  \ {\rm if \ } l_t \leq 1 . 
\end{aligned}
$$

Under this rule, the expected misclassification rate is

$$
p(\textrm{misclassification}) = {1 \over 2} (\tilde \alpha_t + \tilde \beta_t) 
$$ (eq:classerrorprob)

where $\tilde \alpha_t = {\rm Prob}(l_t < 1 \mid f)$ and $\tilde \beta_t = {\rm Prob}(l_t \geq 1 \mid g)$.

Now let's write some code to simulate it

```{code-cell} ipython3
def compute_protocol_2_errors(Ï€_minus_1, T_max, N_simulations, f_func, g_func,
                              F_params=(1, 1), G_params=(3, 1.2)):
    """
    Compute error probabilities for Protocol 2.
    """
    sequences, true_models = protocol_2(Ï€_minus_1, 
                        T_max, N_simulations, F_params, G_params)
    l_ratios, _ = compute_likelihood_ratios(sequences, f_func, g_func)
    
    T_range = np.arange(1, T_max + 1)
    
    accuracy = np.empty(T_max)
    for t in range(T_max):
        predictions = (l_ratios[:, t] >= 1)
        actual = true_models[:, t]
        accuracy[t] = np.mean(predictions == actual)
    
    return {
        'T_range': T_range,
        'accuracy': accuracy,
        'l_ratios': l_ratios,
        'true_models': true_models
    }

```

Since for each $t$, the decision boundary is the same, the decision boundary can be computed as

```{code-cell} ipython3
root = brentq(lambda w: f(w) / g(w) - 1, 0.001, 0.999)
```

we can plot the distributions of $f$ and $g$ and the decision boundary

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7, 6))

w_range = np.linspace(1e-5, 1-1e-5, 1000)
f_values = [f(w) for w in w_range]
g_values = [g(w) for w in w_range]
ratio_values = [f(w)/g(w) for w in w_range]

ax.plot(w_range, f_values, 'b-', 
        label=r'$f(w) \sim Beta(1,1)$', linewidth=2)
ax.plot(w_range, g_values, 'r-', 
        label=r'$g(w) \sim Beta(3,1.2)$', linewidth=2)

type1_prob = 1 - beta_dist.cdf(root, F_a, F_b)
type2_prob = beta_dist.cdf(root, G_a, G_b)

w_type1 = w_range[w_range >= root]
f_type1 = [f(w) for w in w_type1]
ax.fill_between(w_type1, 0, f_type1, alpha=0.3, color='blue', 
                label=fr'$\tilde \alpha_t = {type1_prob:.2f}$')

w_type2 = w_range[w_range <= root]
g_type2 = [g(w) for w in w_type2]
ax.fill_between(w_type2, 0, g_type2, alpha=0.3, color='red', 
                label=fr'$\tilde \beta_t = {type2_prob:.2f}$')

ax.axvline(root, color='green', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7, 
            label=f'decision boundary: $w=${root:.3f}')

ax.set_xlabel('w')
ax.set_ylabel('probability density')
ax.legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

To the left of the green vertical line $g < f$, so $l_t > 1$; therefore a $w_t$ that falls to the left of the green line is classified as a type $f$ individual. 

 * The shaded red area equals $\beta$ -- the probability of classifying someone as a type $g$ individual when it is really a type $f$ individual.

To the right of the green vertical line $g > f$, so $l_t < 1$; therefore a $w_t$ that falls to the right of the green line is classified as a type $g$ individual.

 * The shaded blue area equals $\alpha$ -- the probability of classifying someone as a type $f$ when it is really a type $g$ individual.  

This gives us clues about how to compute the theoretical classification error probability

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Compute theoretical tilde Î±_t and tilde Î²_t
def Î±_integrand(w):
    """Integrand for tilde Î±_t = P(l_t < 1 | f)"""
    return f(w) if f(w) / g(w) < 1 else 0

def Î²_integrand(w):
    """Integrand for tilde Î²_t = P(l_t >= 1 | g)"""
    return g(w) if f(w) / g(w) >= 1 else 0

# Compute the integrals
Î±_theory, _ = quad(Î±_integrand, 0, 1, limit=100)
Î²_theory, _ = quad(Î²_integrand, 0, 1, limit=100)

theory_error = 0.5 * (Î±_theory + Î²_theory)

print(f"theoretical tilde Î±_t = {Î±_theory:.4f}")
print(f"theoretical tilde Î²_t = {Î²_theory:.4f}")
print(f"theoretical classification error probability = {theory_error:.4f}")
```

Now we simulate timing protocol 2 and compute the classification error probability.

In the next cell, we also compare the theoretical classification accuracy to the empirical classification accuracy

```{code-cell} ipython3
def analyze_protocol_2(Ï€_minus_1, T_max, N_simulations, f_func, g_func, 
                      theory_error=None, F_params=(1, 1), G_params=(3, 1.2)):
    """Analyze Protocol 2."""
    result = compute_protocol_2_errors(Ï€_minus_1, T_max, N_simulations, 
                                      f_func, g_func, F_params, G_params)
    
    # Plot results
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.plot(result['T_range'], result['accuracy'], 
            'b-', linewidth=2, label='empirical accuracy')
    
    if theory_error is not None:
        plt.axhline(1 - theory_error, color='r', linestyle='--', 
                   label=f'theoretical accuracy = {1 - theory_error:.4f}')
    
    plt.xlabel('$t$')
    plt.ylabel('accuracy')
    plt.legend()
    plt.ylim(0.5, 1.0)
    plt.show()
    
    return result

# Analyze Protocol 2
result_p2 = analyze_protocol_2(Ï€_minus_1, T_max, N_simulations, f, g, 
                              theory_error, (F_a, F_b), (G_a, G_b))
```

Let's watch decisions made by  the two timing protocols as more and more observations accrue.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def compare_protocols(result1, result2):
    """Compare results from both protocols."""
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    
    plt.plot(result1['T_range'], result1['error_prob'], linewidth=2,

    plt.plot(result2['T_range'], 1 - result2['accuracy'], 
            linestyle='--', linewidth=2, 
            label='Protocol 2 (classification)')
    
    plt.xlabel('$T$')
    plt.ylabel('error probability')
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

```

From the figure above, we can see:

- For both timing protocols, the error probability starts at the same level, subject to a little randomness.

- For timing protocol 1, the error probability decreases as the sample size increases because we are  making just **one** decision -- i.e., selecting whether $f$ or $g$ governs  **all** individuals.  More data provides better evidence.

- For timing protocol 2, the error probability remains constant because we are making **many** decisions -- one classification decision for each observation.  

**Remark:** Think about how laws of large numbers are applied to compute error probabilities for the model selection problem and the classification problem. 

### Error probability and divergence measures

A plausible guess is that the ability of a likelihood ratio to distinguish distributions $f$ and $g$ depends on how "different" they are.
 
We have learnt some measures of "difference" between distributions in {doc}`divergence_measures`.

Let's now study two more measures of "difference" between distributions that are useful in the context of model selection and classification.

Recall that Chernoff entropy between probability densities $f$ and $g$ is defined as:

$$
C(f,g) = - \log \min_{\phi \in (0,1)} \int f^\phi(x) g^{1-\phi}(x) dx
$$

An upper bound on model selection error probability is

$$
e^{-C(f,g)T} .
$$

Let's compute Chernoff entropy numerically with some Python code

```{code-cell} ipython3
def chernoff_integrand(Ï•, f, g):
    """
    Compute the integrand for Chernoff entropy
    """
    def integrand(w):
        return f(w)**Ï• * g(w)**(1-Ï•)
    
    result, _ = quad(integrand, 1e-5, 1-1e-5)
    return result

def compute_chernoff_entropy(f, g):
    """
    Compute Chernoff entropy C(f,g)
    """
    def objective(Ï•):
        return chernoff_integrand(Ï•, f, g)
    
    # Find the minimum over Ï• in (0,1)
    result = minimize_scalar(objective, 
                             bounds=(1e-5, 1-1e-5), 
                             method='bounded')
    min_value = result.fun
    Ï•_optimal = result.x
    
    chernoff_entropy = -np.log(min_value)
    return chernoff_entropy, Ï•_optimal
C_fg, Ï•_optimal = compute_chernoff_entropy(f, g)
print(f"Chernoff entropy C(f,g) = {C_fg:.4f}")
print(f"Optimal Ï• = {Ï•_optimal:.4f}")
```

Now let's examine how $e^{-C(f,g)T}$ behaves as a function of $T$ and compare it to the model selection error probability

```{code-cell} ipython3
T_range = np.arange(1, T_max+1)
chernoff_bound = np.exp(-C_fg * T_range)

# Plot comparison
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))

ax.semilogy(T_range, chernoff_bound, 'r-', linewidth=2, 
           label=f'$e^{{-C(f,g)T}}$')
ax.semilogy(T_range, result_p1['error_prob'], 'b-', linewidth=2, 
           label='Model selection error probability')

ax.set_xlabel('T')
ax.set_ylabel('error probability (log scale)')
ax.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Evidently, $e^{-C(f,g)T}$ is an upper bound on the error rate.

In `{doc}`divergence_measures`, we also studied **Jensen-Shannon divergence** as 
a symmetric measure of distance between distributions.

We can use Jensen-Shannon divergence to measure the distance between distributions $f$ and $g$ and 
compute how it covaries with the model selection error probability.

We also compute Jensen-Shannon divergence numerically with some Python code

```{code-cell} ipython3
def compute_JS(f, g):
    """
    Compute Jensen-Shannon divergence
    """
    def m(w):
        return 0.5 * (f(w) + g(w))
    
    js_div = 0.5 * compute_KL(f, m) + 0.5 * compute_KL(g, m)
    return js_div
```

Now let's return to our guess that the error probability at large sample sizes is related to the Chernoff entropy  between two distributions.

We verify this by computing the correlation between the log of the error probability at $T=50$ under Timing Protocol 1 and the divergence measures.

In the simulation below, nature draws $N / 2$ sequences from $g$ and $N/2$ sequences from $f$.

```{note}
Nature does this rather than flipping a fair coin to decide whether to draw from $g$ or $f$ once and for all before each simulation of length $T$.
```

We use the following pairs of Beta distributions for $f$ and $g$ as test cases

```{code-cell} ipython3
distribution_pairs = [
    # (f_params, g_params)
    ((1, 1), (0.1, 0.2)),
    ((1, 1), (0.3, 0.3)),
    ((1, 1), (0.3, 0.4)),
    ((1, 1), (0.5, 0.5)),
    ((1, 1), (0.7, 0.6)),
    ((1, 1), (0.9, 0.8)),
    ((1, 1), (1.1, 1.05)),
    ((1, 1), (1.2, 1.1)),
    ((1, 1), (1.5, 1.2)),
    ((1, 1), (2, 1.5)),
    ((1, 1), (2.5, 1.8)),
    ((1, 1), (3, 1.2)),
    ((1, 1), (4, 1)),
    ((1, 1), (5, 1))
]
```

Now let's run the simmulation

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Parameters for simulation
T_large = 50
N_sims = 5000
N_half = N_sims // 2

# Initialize arrays
n_pairs = len(distribution_pairs)

chernoff_vals = np.zeros(n_pairs)
error_probs = np.zeros(n_pairs)
pair_names = []

for i, ((f_a, f_b), (g_a, g_b)) in enumerate(distribution_pairs):
    # Create density functions
    f = jit(lambda x, a=f_a, b=f_b: p(x, a, b))
    g = jit(lambda x, a=g_a, b=g_b: p(x, a, b))

    # Compute divergence measures
    kl_fg_vals[i] = compute_KL(f, g)
    kl_gf_vals[i] = compute_KL(g, f)
    js_vals[i] = compute_JS(f, g)
    chernoff_vals[i], _ = compute_chernoff_entropy(f, g)

    # Generate samples
    sequences_f = np.random.beta(f_a, f_b, (N_half, T_large))
    sequences_g = np.random.beta(g_a, g_b, (N_half, T_large))

    # Compute likelihood ratios and cumulative products
    _, L_cumulative_f = compute_likelihood_ratios(sequences_f, f, g)
    _, L_cumulative_g = compute_likelihood_ratios(sequences_g, f, g)
    
    # Get final values
    L_cumulative_f = L_cumulative_f[:, -1]
    L_cumulative_g = L_cumulative_g[:, -1]

    # Calculate error probabilities
    error_probs[i] = 0.5 * (np.mean(L_cumulative_f < 1) + 
                            np.mean(L_cumulative_g >= 1))
    pair_names.append(f"Beta({f_a},{f_b}) and Beta({g_a},{g_b})")

cor_data =  {
    'kl_fg': kl_fg_vals,

    # Plot both correlations
    plot_correlation(ax1, js_vals, 'JS divergence', 'C0')
    plot_correlation(ax2, chernoff_vals, 'Chernoff entropy', 'C1')

    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

plot_error_divergence(cor_data)
```

Evidently, Chernoff entropy and Jensen-Shannon entropy each covary tightly with the model selection error probability.

We'll encounter related ideas in {doc}`wald_friedman` very soon.

(lrp_markov)=
## Markov chains 

Let's now look at a likelihood ratio process for a sequence of random variables that is not independently and identically distributed.

Here we assume that the sequence is generated by a Markov chain on a finite state space.

We consider two $n$-state irreducible and aperiodic Markov chain models on the same state space $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ with positive transition matrices $P^{(f)}$, $P^{(g)}$ and initial distributions $\pi_0^{(f)}$, $\pi_0^{(g)}$.

We assume that nature samples from chain $f$.

For a sample path $(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_T)$, let $N_{ij}$ count transitions from state $i$ to $j$.

The likelihood process under model $m \in \{f, g\}$ is

$$
L_T^{(m)} = \pi_{0,x_0}^{(m)} \prod_{i=1}^n \prod_{j=1}^n \left(P_{ij}^{(m)}\right)^{N_{ij}}
$$

Hence, 

$$
\log L_T^{(m)} =\log\pi_{0,x_0}^{(m)} +\sum_{i,j}N_{ij}\log P_{ij}^{(m)}
$$

The log-likelihood ratio is

$$
\log \frac{L_T^{(f)}}{L_T^{(g)}} = \log \frac{\pi_{0,x_0}^{(f)}}{\pi_{0,x_0}^{(g)}} + \sum_{i,j}N_{ij}\log \frac{P_{ij}^{(f)}}{P_{ij}^{(g)}}
$$ (eq:llr_markov)

### KL divergence rate

By the ergodic theorem for irreducible, aperiodic Markov chains, we have

$$
\frac{N_{ij}}{T} \xrightarrow{a.s.} \pi_i^{(f)}P_{ij}^{(f)} \quad \text{as } T \to \infty
$$

where $\boldsymbol{\pi}^{(f)}$ is the stationary distribution satisfying $\boldsymbol{\pi}^{(f)} = \boldsymbol{\pi}^{(f)} P^{(f)}$.

Therefore,

$$
\frac{1}{T}\log \frac{L_T^{(f)}}{L_T^{(g)}} = \frac{1}{T}\log \frac{\pi_{0,x_0}^{(f)}}{\pi_{0,x_0}^{(g)}} + \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i,j}N_{ij}\log \frac{P_{ij}^{(f)}}{P_{ij}^{(g)}}
$$

Taking the limit as $T \to \infty$, we have:
- The first term: $\frac{1}{T}\log \frac{\pi_{0,x_0}^{(f)}}{\pi_{0,x_0}^{(g)}} \to 0$
- The second term: $\frac{1}{T}\sum_{i,j}N_{ij}\log \frac{P_{ij}^{(f)}}{P_{ij}^{(g)}} \xrightarrow{a.s.} \sum_{i,j}\pi_i^{(f)}P_{ij}^{(f)}\log \frac{P_{ij}^{(f)}}{P_{ij}^{(g)}}$

Define the **KL divergence rate** as

$$
h_{KL}(f, g) = \sum_{i=1}^n \pi_i^{(f)} \underbrace{\sum_{j=1}^n P_{ij}^{(f)} \log \frac{P_{ij}^{(f)}}{P_{ij}^{(g)}}}_{=: KL(P_{i\cdot}^{(f)}, P_{i\cdot}^{(g)})}
$$

where $KL(P_{i\cdot}^{(f)}, P_{i\cdot}^{(g)})$ is the row-wise KL divergence.

 
By the ergodic theorem, we have

$$
\frac{1}{T}\log \frac{L_T^{(f)}}{L_T^{(g)}} \xrightarrow{a.s.} h_{KL}(f, g) \quad \text{as } T \to \infty
$$

Taking expectations and using the dominated convergence theorem, we obtain

$$
\frac{1}{T}E_f\left[\log \frac{L_T^{(f)}}{L_T^{(g)}}\right] \to h_{KL}(f, g) \quad \text{as } T \to \infty
$$

Here we invite readers to pause and compare this result with {eq}`eq:kl_likelihood_link`.

Let's confirm this in the simulation below.

### Simulations

Let's implement simulations to illustrate these concepts with a three-state Markov chain.

We start by writing functions to compute the stationary distribution and the KL divergence rate for Markov chain models.

```

Now let's create an example with two different 3-state Markov chains.

We are now ready to simulate paths and visualize how likelihood ratios evolve.

We verify $\frac{1}{T}E_f\left[\log \frac{L_T^{(f)}}{L_T^{(g)}}\right] = h_{KL}(f, g)$ starting from the stationary distribution by plotting both the empirical average and the line predicted by the theory

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Define example Markov chain transition matrices
P_f = np.array([[0.7, 0.2, 0.1],
                [0.3, 0.5, 0.2],
                [0.1, 0.3, 0.6]])

P_g = np.array([[0.5, 0.3, 0.2],
                [0.2, 0.6, 0.2],
                [0.2, 0.2, 0.6]])

## Exercises

```{exercise}
:label: lr_ex1

Consider the setting where nature generates data from a third density $h$. 

Let $\{w_t\}_{t=1}^T$ be IID draws from $h$, and let $L_t = L(w^t)$ be the likelihood ratio process defined as in the lecture.

Show that:

$$
\frac{1}{t} E_h[\log L_t] = K_g - K_f
$$

with finite $K_g, K_f$, $E_h |\log f(W)| < \infty$ and $E_h |\log g(W)| < \infty$.

*Hint:* Start by expressing $\log L_t$ as a sum of $\log \ell(w_i)$ terms and compare with the definition of $K_f$ and $K_g$.
```

```{solution-start} lr_ex1
:class: dropdown
```

Since $w_1, \ldots, w_t$ are IID draws from $h$, we can write

$$
\log L_t = \log \prod_{i=1}^t \ell(w_i) = \sum_{i=1}^t \log \ell(w_i) = \sum_{i=1}^t \log \frac{f(w_i)}{g(w_i)}
$$

Taking the expectation under $h$

$$
E_h[\log L_t] 
= E_h\left[\sum_{i=1}^t \log \frac{f(w_i)}{g(w_i)}\right] 
= \sum_{i=1}^t E_h\left[\log \frac{f(w_i)}{g(w_i)}\right]
$$

Since the $w_i$ are identically distributed

$$
E_h[\log L_t] = t \cdot E_h\left[\log \frac{f(w)}{g(w)}\right]
$$

where $w \sim h$.

Therefore

$$
\frac{1}{t} E_h[\log L_t] = E_h\left[\log \frac{f(w)}{g(w)}\right] = E_h[\log f(w)] - E_h[\log g(w)]
$$

Now, from the definition of Kullback-Leibler divergence

$$
K_f = \int h(w) \log \frac{h(w)}{f(w)} dw = E_h[\log h(w)] - E_h[\log f(w)]
$$

This gives us

$$
E_h[\log f(w)] = E_h[\log h(w)] - K_f
$$

Similarly

$$
E_h[\log g(w)] = E_h[\log h(w)] - K_g
$$

Substituting back

Building on {ref}`lr_ex1`, use the result to explain what happens to $L_t$ as $t \to \infty$ in the following cases:

1. When $K_g > K_f$ (i.e., $f$ is "closer" to $h$ than $g$ is)
2. When $K_g < K_f$ (i.e., $g$ is "closer" to $h$ than $f$ is)

Relate your answer to the simulation results shown in {ref}`this section <llr_h>`.

From {ref}`lr_ex1`, we know that:

$$
\frac{1}{t} E_h[\log L_t] = K_g - K_f
$$

**Case 1:** When $K_g > K_f$ 

Here, $f$ is "closer" to $h$ than $g$ is. Since $K_g - K_f > 0$

$$
E_h[\log L_t] = t \cdot (K_g - K_f) \to +\infty \text{ as } t \to \infty
$$

By the Law of Large Numbers, $\frac{1}{t} \log L_t \to K_g - K_f > 0$ almost surely.

Therefore $L_t \to +\infty$ almost surely.

**Case 2:** When $K_g < K_f$

Here, $g$ is "closer" to $h$ than $f$ is. Since $K_g - K_f < 0$

$$
E_h[\log L_t] = t \cdot (K_g - K_f) \to -\infty \text{ as } t \to \infty
$$

Therefore by similar reasoning $L_t \to 0$ almost surely.
