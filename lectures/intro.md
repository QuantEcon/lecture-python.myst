# Quantitative Economics with Python

This website presents a set of lectures on quantitative economic modeling, designed and written by
[Thomas J. Sargent](http://www.tomsargent.com/) and [John Stachurski](http://johnstachurski.net/).

```{admonition} News
[QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org) is moving to the [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html)
build system for all of its projects. We are a founding member of the
[Executable Books Project](https://github.com/executablebooks), an international collaboration to
build open source tools that facilitate publishing using the Jupyter
ecosystem. Please send feedback to [contact@quantecon.org](mailto:contact@quantecon.org)
```

For an overview of the series, see [this page](https://quantecon.org/python-lectures/)
