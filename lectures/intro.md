# Quantitative Economics with Python

This website presents a set of lectures on quantitative economic modeling, designed and written by
[Thomas J. Sargent](http://www.tomsargent.com/) and [John Stachurski](http://johnstachurski.net/).

```{admonition} News
[QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org) is moving to the [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html)
build system for all of its projects. We are a founding member of the
[Executable Books Project](https://github.com/executablebooks) and this
is the first in the QuantEcon lecture series to migrate. Please send feedback to [contact@quantecon.org](mailto:contact@quantecon.org)
```

For an overview of the series, see [this page](https://quantecon.org/python-lectures/)

```{admonition} Previous website
While this new site will receive all future updates, you may still view the [old site here](https://python-rst.quantecon.org) for the next month.
