# Speculative Behavior with Bayesian Learning

```{index} single: Models; Morris Learning
```

```{contents} Contents
:depth: 2
```

## Overview

This lecture describes how {cite:t}`Morris1996` extended the Harrisonâ€“Kreps model {cite}`HarrKreps1978` of speculative asset pricing.

Like Harrison and Kreps's model, Harris's model determines the price of a dividend-yielding asset that is traded by risk-neutral investors who have heterogeneous beliefs.

The Harrison-Kreps model assumes that the traders have dogmatic, hard-wired beliefs about the asset's payout stream, i.e., its dividend stream or "fundamentals".

Morris replaced Harrison and Kreps's traders with  hard-wired beliefs about the dividend stream with traders who use Bayes' Law to update their beliefs about prospective dividends as new dividend data arrive.

```{note}
But Morris's traders don't use data on past prices of the asset to update their beliefs about the 
dividend process.
```

Key features of Morris's model include:

* All traders share a manifold of statistical models for prospective dividends
* The manifold of statistical models is characterized by a single parameter
* All traders observe the same dividend histories
* All traders use Bayes' Law to update beliefs
* Traders have different initial *prior distributions* over the parameter that indexes the common statistical model
* Until traders'  *posterior distributions* over that parameter eventually merge, traders disagree about the  predictive density over prospective dividends and therefore about the expected present value of dividend streams, which  trader regards as the  *fundamental value* of the asset

```{note}
Morris has thereby set things up so that after long enough histories, traders eventually agree about the tail of the asset's dividend stream.
```

Thus, although traders have identical *information*, i.e., histories of information, they  have different *posterior distributions* for prospective dividends.

Just as in the hard-wired beliefs model of Harrison and Kreps, those differences set the stage for the emergence of an environment in which investors  engange in *speculative behavior* in the sense that sometimes  they place a  value on the asset that exceeds what they regard as its fundamental value, i.e., the present value of its prospective dividend stream. 

Let's start with some standard imports:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Prior to reading this lecture, you might want to review the following quantecon lectures:

* {doc}`Harrison-Kreps model <harrison_kreps>`
* {doc}`Likelihood ratio processes <likelihood_ratio_process>`
* {doc}`Bayesian versus frequentist statistics <likelihood_bayes>`


## Structure of the model

There is a fixed supply of shares of an asset.

Each share entitles its owner to a stream of *binary* i.i.d. dividends $\{d_t\}$ where

$$
d_{t+1} \in \{0,1\}
$$

The dividend at time $t$ equals $1$ with unknown probability $\theta \in (0,1)$ and equals $0$ with probability $1-\theta$.

Unlike {cite}`HarrKreps1978` where traders have hard-wired beliefs about a Markov transition matrix, in Morris's model:

* The true dividend probability $\theta$ is unknown
* Traders have *prior beliefs* about $\theta$
* Traders observe dividend realizations and update beliefs via Bayes' Law

There is a finite set $\mathcal{I}$ of *risk-neutral* traders.

All traders have the same discount factor $\beta \in (0,1)$.

* You can think of $\beta$ as being related to a net risk-free interest rate $r$ by $\beta = 1/(1+r)$.

Owning the asset at the end of period $t$ entitles the owner to divdends at time $t+1, t+2, \ldots$.  

Because the dividend process is i.i.d.,  trader $i$ thinks that  the fundamental value of the asset is the capitalized value of the dividend stream, namely,  $\sum_{j=1}^\infty \beta^j \hat \theta_i 
= \frac{\hat \theta_i}{r}$, where $\hat \theta_i$ is the mean of the  trader's posterior distribution over $\theta$.

### Possible trades

Traders buy and sell the risky asset in competitive markets each period $t = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$ after dividends are paid.

As in Harrison-Kreps:

* The asset is traded *ex dividend*
* An owner of a share at the end of time $t$ is entitled to the dividend at time $t+1$
* An owner of a share at the end of period $t$ also has the right to sell the share at time $t+1$ after having received the dividend at time $t+1$.

*Short sales are prohibited*.

This matters because it limits how pessimists can express their opinions:

* They *can* express themselves by selling their shares
* They *cannot* express themselves more loudly by borrowing shares and selling them

All traders have sufficient wealth to purchase the risky asset.

## Information and beliefs

All traders observe the same dividend history $(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_t)$.

Based on that information flow, all traders their subjective distribution over $\theta$ by applying Bayes' rule.

However, traders have *heterogeneous priors* over the unknown dividend probability $\theta$.

This heterogeneity in priors produces heterogeneous posterior beliefs.

## Source of heterogeneous priors

Imputing different statistical models to agents inside a model is controversial.

Many  game theorists and rational expectations applied economists think it is a bad idea.

While they often construct models in which agents have different *information*, they prefer to assume that all agents inside the model
share the same statistical model -- i.e., the same joint probability distribution over the random processes being modeled.  

For a statistician or an economic theorist, a statistical model is joint probability distribution that is characeterized  by a known parameter vector.

When working with  a *manifold* of statistical models swept out  by  parameters, say $\theta$ in a known set $\Theta$, economic theorists 
reduce that manifold of models to a single model by imputing to all agents inside the model the same prior probability distribution over $\theta$.

This is called the *Harsanyi Doctrine* or *Common Priors Doctrine*.



{cite}`harsanyi1967games`,  {cite}`harsanyi1968games`,  {cite}`harsanyi1968games3` argued that if two rational agents have
the same information and the same reasoning capabilities, they should have same joint probability distribution over outcomes of interest. 
He wanted to interpret disagreements as coming from different  information sets,  not from different statistical models. 





Notice how {cite}`HarrKreps1978` had also abandoned Harsanyi common statistical model assumption when they  hard-wired dogmatic disparate beliefs.

{cite:t}`Morris1996` evidently abandons the Harsanyi approach only partly -- he retains the assumption that agents share the same 
manifold of statistical model.  

Morris's agents simply express their initial ignorance parameter differently -- they have different priors. 


Morris defends his assumption by alluding to an application that concerns him, namely, the observations about apparent ''mispricing'' of initial public offerings presented by {cite}`miller1977risk`.

This is a situation in which agents have access to  little or no data about a project and want to be open to changing their opinions as data flow in.

Morris motivates his diverse-priors assumption by noting that there are two *different* ways to express ''maximal ignorance'' about the parameter of a Bernoulli distribution

 * a uniform distribution on $[0, 1]$
 * a Jeffrey's prior {cite}`jeffreys1946invariant` that is invariant to reparameterization; this has the form of a Beta distribution with parameters 
   $.5, .5$

Is one of these priors more rational than the other?

Morris thinks not. 




## Beta priors 

For tractability, assume trader $i$ has a Beta prior over the dividend probability 

$$
\theta \sim \text{Beta}(a_i, b_i)
$$

where $a_i, b_i > 0$ are the prior parameters.

```{note}
The  Beta distribution also appears in these  quantecon lectures {doc}`divergence_measures`,  {doc}`likelihood_ratio_process`,  {doc}`odu`.
```

Suppose trader $i$ observes a history of $t$ periods in which a total of $s$ dividends are paid 
(i.e., $s$ successes with dividend and $t-s$ failures without dividend). 

By Bayes' rule, the posterior density over $\theta$ is:

$$
\pi_i(\theta \mid s, t) = \frac{\theta^s (1-\theta)^{t-s} \pi_i(\theta)}{\int_0^1 \theta^s (1-\theta)^{t-s} \pi_i(\theta) d\theta}
$$

where $\pi_i(\theta)$ is trader $i$'s prior density.

```{note}
The Beta distribution is the conjugate prior for the Binomial likelihood. This means that when the prior is $\text{Beta}(a_i, b_i)$ and we observe $s$ successes in $t$ trials, the posterior is $\text{Beta}(a_i+s, b_i+t-s)$.
```

The posterior mean (or expected dividend probability) is:

$$
\mu_i(s,t) = \int_0^1 \theta \pi_i(\theta \mid s, t) d\theta 
= \mathbb{E}[\text{Beta}(a_i+s, b_i+t-s)] = \frac{a_i + s}{a_i + b_i + t}
$$

Morris refers to $\mu_i(s,t)$ as trader $i$'s **fundamental valuation** of the asset after history $(s,t)$. 

This is the probability trader $i$ assigns to receiving a dividend next period.

It embeds trader $i$'s updated belief about $\theta$.

## Market prices with learning

Fundamental valuations equal expected present values of dividends that our heterogeneous traders
attach to the option of holding the asset *forever*. 

The equilibrium price process is determined by the condition that the asset is held at time $t$ by the trader who attaches the highest valuation to the asset at time $t$.

An owner of the asset has the option to sell it after receiving that period's dividend.

Traders take that into account.

That opens the possibility that  a trader will be willing to pay more for the asset than that trader's fundamental valuation.

```{prf:definition} Most Optimistic Valuation
:label: most_optimistic_valuation

After history $(s,t)$, the *most optimistic fundamental valuation* is:

$$
\mu^*(s,t) = \max_{i \in \mathcal{I}} \mu_i(s,t)
$$
```

```{prf:definition} Equilibrium Asset Price
:label: equilibrium_asset_price

Write $\tilde{p}(s,t,r)$ for the competitive equilibrium price of the risky asset (in current dollars) after history $(s,t)$ when the interest rate is $r$. 

The equilibrium price satisfies:

$$
\tilde{p}(s,t,r) = \frac{1}{1+r} \Bigl[ \mu^*(s,t) \{1 + \tilde{p}(s+1,t+1,r)\} 
+ (1 - \mu^*(s,t)) \tilde{p}(s,t+1,r) \Bigr]
$$
```

The equilibrium price equals the highest expected discounted return among all traders from holding the asset to the next period.

```{prf:definition} Normalized Price
:label: normalized_price

Define the normalized price as:

$$
p(s,t,r) = r \tilde{p}(s,t,r)
$$

Since the current "dollar" price of the riskless asset is $1/r$, this represents the price of the risky asset in terms of the riskless asset.
```

Substituting the preceding formula into the equilibrium condition gives:

$$
p(s,t,r) = \frac{r}{1+r} \mu^*(s,t) + \frac{1}{1+r} 
\Bigl[ \mu^*(s,t) p(s+1,t+1,r) + (1 - \mu^*(s,t)) p(s,t+1,r) \Bigr]
$$

or equivalently:

$$
p(s,t,r) = \mu^*(s,t) + \frac{r}{1+r} 
\Bigl[ \mu^*(s,t) p(s+1,t+1,r) + (1 - \mu^*(s,t)) p(s,t+1,r) - \mu^*(s,t) \Bigr]
$$

A price function that satisfies the equilibrium condition can be computed recursively.

Set $p^0(s,t,r) = 0$ for all $(s,t,r)$, and define $p^{n+1}(s,t,r)$ by:

$$
p^{n+1}(s,t,r) = \frac{r}{1+r} \mu^*(s,t) + \frac{1}{1+r} 
\Bigl[ \mu^*(s,t) p^n(s+1,t+1,r) + (1 - \mu^*(s,t)) p^n(s,t+1,r) \Bigr]
$$

The sequence $\{p^n(s,t,r)\}$ converges to the equilibrium price $p(s,t,r)$.

```{prf:definition} Speculative Premium
:label: speculative_premium

When the identity of the most optimistic trader can switch with future dividend realizations, the market price exceeds *every* trader's fundamental valuation. 

In normalized units:

$$
p(s,t,r) > \mu_i(s,t) \quad \text{for all } i \in \mathcal{I}
$$

Define the **speculative premium** as:

$$
p(s,t,r) - \mu^*(s,t) > 0
$$
```


## Two Traders

We now focus on an example with two traders with Beta  priors with parameters $(a_1,b_1)$ and $(a_2,b_2)$.

```{prf:definition} Rate Dominance (Beta Priors)
:label: rate_dominance_beta

Trader 1 **rate-dominates** trader 2 if:

$$
a_1 \geq a_2 \quad \text{and} \quad b_1 \leq b_2
$$
```

```{prf:theorem} Global Optimist (Two Traders)
:label: two_trader_optimist

For two traders with Beta priors:

1. If trader 1 rate-dominates trader 2, then trader 1 is a **global optimist**: $\mu_1(s,t) \geq \mu_2(s,t)$ for all histories $(s,t)$
2. In this case where $p(s,t,r) = \mu_1(s,t)$ for all $(s,t,r)$, there is *no speculative premium*.
```

When neither trader rate-dominates the other, the identity of the most optimistic trader can switch as dividends accrue.

Along a history in which perpetual switching occurs, the price of the asset strictly exceeds both traders' fundamental valuations so long as traders continue to disagree:

$$
p(s,t,r) > \max\{\mu_1(s,t), \mu_2(s,t)\}
$$

Thus, along such a history, there is a persistent speculative premium.

### Implementation

For computational tractability, let's work with a finite horizon $T$ and solve by backward induction.

```{note}
{cite:t}`Morris1996` page 1122 provides an argument that the limit as $T\rightarrow + \infty$ of such finite-horizon economies provides a useful
selection algorithm that excludes additional equilibria that involve a Ponzi-scheme price component that Morris dismisses as fragile. 
```

We use the discount factor parameterization $\beta = 1/(1+r)$ and compute dollar prices $\tilde{p}(s,t)$ via:

$$
\tilde{p}(s,t) = \beta \max_{i\in\{1,2\}} \Bigl[ \mu_i(s,t) \{1 + \tilde{p}(s+1,t+1)\} + (1-\mu_i(s,t)) \tilde{p}(s,t+1) \Bigr]
$$

We set the terminal price $\tilde{p}(s,T)$ equal to the perpetuity value under the most optimistic belief.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def posterior_mean(a, b, s, t):
    """
    Compute posterior mean Î¼_i(s,t) for Beta(a, b) prior.
    """
    return (a + s) / (a + b + t)

def perpetuity_value(a, b, s, t, Î²=.75):
    """
    Compute perpetuity value (Î²/(1-Î²)) * Î¼_i(s,t).
    """
    return (Î² / (1 - Î²)) * posterior_mean(a, b, s, t)

    price_array = np.zeros((T+1, T+1))

    # Terminal condition: set to perpetuity value under max belief
    for s in range(T+1):
        perp1 = perpetuity_value(a1, b1, s, T, Î²)
        perp2 = perpetuity_value(a2, b2, s, T, Î²)
        price_array[s, T] = max(perp1, perp2)

    # Backward induction
    for t in range(T-1, -1, -1):
        for s in range(t, -1, -1):
            Î¼1 = posterior_mean(a1, b1, s, t)
            Î¼2 = posterior_mean(a2, b2, s, t)
            
            # One-step continuation values under each trader's beliefs
            cont1 = Î¼1 * (1.0 + price_array[s+1, t+1]) \
                    + (1.0 - Î¼1) * price_array[s, t+1]
            cont2 = Î¼2 * (1.0 + price_array[s+1, t+1]) \
                    + (1.0 - Î¼2) * price_array[s, t+1]
            price_array[s, t] = Î² * max(cont1, cont2)

    def Î¼1_fun(s, t):
        return posterior_mean(a1, b1, s, t)
    def Î¼2_fun(s, t):
        return posterior_mean(a2, b2, s, t)

    return price_array, Î¼1_fun, Î¼2_fun
```

(hk_go)=
### Case A: global optimist (no premium) 

Pick priors with rate dominance, e.g., trader 1: $\text{Beta}(a_1,b_1)=(2,1)$ and trader 2: $(a_2,b_2)=(1,2)$. 

Trader 1 is the global optimist, so the normalized price equals trader 1's fundamental valuation: $p(s,t,r) = \mu_1(s,t)$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
Î² = 0.75
price_go, Î¼1_go, Î¼2_go = price_learning_two_agents(
        (2,1), (1,2), Î²=Î², T=200)

perpetuity_1 = (Î² / (1 - Î²)) * Î¼1_go(0, 0)
perpetuity_2 = (Î² / (1 - Î²)) * Î¼2_go(0, 0)

print("Price at (0, 0) =", price_go[0,0])
print("Valuation of trader 1 at (0, 0) =", perpetuity_1)
print("Valuation of trader 2 at (0, 0) =", perpetuity_2)
```

The price equals trader 1's perpetuity value.

### Case B: perpetual switching (positive premium)

Now assume trader 1 has $\text{Beta}(1,1)$, trader 2 has $\text{Beta}(1/2,1/2)$. 

These produce crossing posteriors, so there is no global optimist and the price exceeds both fundamentals early on.

```{code-cell} ipython3
price_ps, Î¼1_ps, Î¼2_ps = price_learning_two_agents(
                                (1,1), (0.5,0.5), Î²=Î², T=200)

price_00 = price_ps[0,0]
Î¼1_00 = Î¼1_ps(0,0)
Î¼2_00 = Î¼2_ps(0,0)

perpetuity_1 = (Î² / (1 - Î²)) * Î¼1_ps(0, 0)
perpetuity_2 = (Î² / (1 - Î²)) * Î¼2_ps(0, 0)

print("Price at (0, 0) =", np.round(price_00, 6))
print("Valuation of trader 1 at (0, 0) =", perpetuity_1)
print("Valuation of trader 2 at (0, 0) =", perpetuity_2)
```

The resulting premium reflects the option value of reselling to whichever trader becomes temporarily more optimistic as dividends arrive sequentially.

Within this setting, we can reproduce two key figures reported in {cite:t}`Morris1996`

```{code-cell} ipython3
def normalized_price_two_agents(prior1, prior2, r, T=250):
    """Return p(s,t,r) = r Â· \tilde p(s,t,r) for two traders."""
    Î² = 1.0 / (1.0 + r)
    price_array, *_ = price_learning_two_agents(prior1, prior2, Î²=Î², T=T)
    return r * price_array

# Figure I: p*(0,0,r) as a function of r
r_grid = np.linspace(1e-3, 5.0, 200)
priors = ((1,1), (0.5,0.5))
p00 = np.array([normalized_price_two_agents(
                priors[0], priors[1], r, T=300)[0,0]
                for r in r_grid])

plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
plt.plot(r_grid, p00)
plt.xlabel('r')
plt.ylabel(r'$p^*(0,0,r)$')
plt.axhline(0.5, color='C1', linestyle='--')
plt.title('Figure I: normalized price vs interest rate')
plt.show()
```

In the first figure, notice that:

- The resale option pushes the normalized price $p^*(0,0,r)$ above fundamentals $(0.5)$ for any finite $r$. 

- As $r$ increases ($\beta$ decreases), the option value fades and $p^*(0,0,r) \to 0.5$. 

- At $r = 0.05$ the premium is about $8â€“9\%$, consistent with Morris (1996, Section IV).


```{code-cell} ipython3
# Figure II: p*(t/2,t,0.05) as a function of t
r = 0.05
T = 60
p_mat = normalized_price_two_agents(priors[0], priors[1], r, T=T)
t_vals = np.arange(0, 54, 2) 
s_vals = t_vals // 2
y = np.array([p_mat[s, t] for s, t in zip(s_vals, t_vals)])

plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
plt.plot(t_vals, y)
plt.xlabel('t')
plt.ylabel(r'$p^*(t/2,t,0.05)$')
plt.axhline(0.5, color='C1', linestyle='--')
plt.title('Figure II: normalized price vs time (r=0.05)')
plt.show()

p0 = p_mat[0,0]
mu0 = 0.5  
print("Initial normalized premium at r=0.05 (%):",
      np.round(100 * (p0 / mu0 - 1.0), 2))
```

In the second figure, notice that:

- Along the symmetric path $s = t/2$, both tradersâ€™ fundamentals equal $0.5$ at every $t$, yet the price starts above $0.5$ and declines toward $0.5$ as learning reduces disagreement and the resale option loses value. 


### General Nâ€“trader extension

The same recursion extends to any finite set of Beta priors $\{(a_i,b_i)\}_{i=1}^N$ by taking a max over $i$ each period.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def price_learning(priors, Î²=.75, T=200):
    """
    N-trader version with heterogeneous Beta priors.
    """
    price_array = np.zeros((T+1, T+1))

    def perp_i(i, s, t):
        a, b = priors[i]
        return perpetuity_value(a, b, s, t, Î²)

    # Terminal condition
    for s in range(T+1):
        price_array[s, T] = max(
            perp_i(i, s, T) for i in range(len(priors)))

    # Backward induction
    for t in range(T-1, -1, -1):
        for s in range(t, -1, -1):
            conts = []
            for (a, b) in priors:
                Î¼ = posterior_mean(a, b, s, t)
                conts.append(Î¼ * 
                (1.0 + price_array[s+1, t+1]) 
                     + (1.0 - Î¼) * price_array[s, t+1])
            price_array[s, t] = Î² * max(conts)

    return price_array

Î² = .75
priors = [(1,1), (0.5,0.5), (3,2)]
price_N = price_learning(priors, Î²=Î², T=150)

# Compute valuations for each trader at (0,0)
mu_vals = [posterior_mean(a, b, 0, 0) for a, b in priors]
perp_vals = [(Î² / (1 - Î²)) * mu for mu in mu_vals]

print("Three-trader example at (s,t)=(0,0):")
print(f"Price at (0,0) = {np.round(price_N[0,0], 6)}")
print(f"\nTrader valuations:")
for i, (mu, perp) in enumerate(zip(mu_vals, perp_vals), 1):
    print(f"  Trader {i} = {np.round(perp, 6)}")
```

Note that the asset price is above all traders' valuations.

Morris tells us that no rate dominance exists in this case.

Let's verify this using the code below

```{code-cell} ipython3
dominant = None
for i in range(len(priors)):
    is_dom = all(
        priors[i][0] >= priors[j][0] and priors[i][1] <= priors[j][1]
                 for j in range(len(priors)) if i != j)
    if is_dom:
        dominant = i
        break

if dominant is not None:
    print(f"\nTrader {dominant+1} is the global optimist (rate-dominant)")
else:
    print(f"\nNo global optimist and speculative premium exists")
```

Indeed, there is no global optimist and a speculative premium exists.

## Concluding remarks

{cite:t}`Morris1996` uses his model to interpret a ''hot issue'' anomaly described by {cite}`miller1977risk` according to which opening market prices of initial public offerings seem higher than values  prices that emerge later.  



## Exercise

```{exercise-start}
:label: hk_ex3
```

Morris {cite}`Morris1996` provides a sharp characterization of when speculative bubbles arise.

The key condition is that there is no *global optimist*.

In this exercise, you will verify this condition for the following sets of traders with Beta priors:

1. Trader 1: $\text{Beta}(2,1)$, Trader 2: $\text{Beta}(1,2)$
2. Trader 1: $\text{Beta}(1,1)$, Trader 2: $\text{Beta}(1/2,1/2)$
3. Trader 1: $\text{Beta}(3,1)$, Trader 2: $\text{Beta}(2,1)$, Trader 3: $\text{Beta}(1,2)$
4. Trader 1: $\text{Beta}(1,1)$, Trader 2: $\text{Beta}(1/2,1/2)$, Trader 3: $\text{Beta}(3/2,3/2)$
