```{admonition} GPU
:class: warning

This lecture is accelerated via [hardware](status:machine-details) that has access to a GPU and JAX for GPU programming.

Free GPUs are available on Google Colab. To use this option, please click on the play icon top right, select Colab, and set the runtime environment to include a GPU.

Alternatively, if you have your own GPU, you can follow the [instructions](https://github.com/google/jax) for installing JAX with GPU support. If you would like to install jax running on the `cpu` only you can use `pip install jax[cpu]`
